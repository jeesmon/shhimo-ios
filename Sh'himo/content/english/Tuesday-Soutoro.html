Lord's Prayer</span><br>

<br>

Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread: and forgive us our debts and sins, as we also have
forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
the evil one. For Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory,
forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.<br>

<br>

Hail Mary</span><br>

<br>

Hail, Mary, full of Grace, our Lord is with thee; blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, our Lord Jesus
Christ. Oh Virgin Saint Mary, Oh Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at all times, and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Introductory Prayer of Soutoro</span><br>

<br>

Protect us, Lord, beneath the wings of your&nbsp; loving kindness and turn
our hard hearts to the knowledge of your truth; grant us to know and to
consider that the evening which has called us to rest and refreshment
from labor is a figure of the end of this present life; that we may be
diligent in good actions which are pleasing to your will, and we will
offer your praise and thanksgiving, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; now
and always and forever and ever. Amen.<br>

<br>

<br>

O you the slain, who by your slaying slew the evil one and death which
slew Adam, slay the sin which dwells in me and makes me its slave by my
own will. O good shepherd, who went in search of the sheep which had
strayed from the flock and was lost, seek for me who am lost like the
one coin out of ten which the woman had lost, because you are he who
finds those who are lost; and I will cry and say: glory to him who
makes his servants return, hallelulia, praise to him. <br>

<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">
Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br>

<br>

Do not fear, sinner, to tread the way of repentance; for the Lord is
gone in search of you and greatly will he rejoice if he finds you; he
will stretch out his hand to you, as to Simon, and will forgive you
your sins like the sinful woman; he will open the door of paradise to
you, as to the thief, and will and rejoice in you and receive you
better than those who remain; he will bear you on his shoulders and
carry you in honor, hallelulia, and will embrace you. <br>

<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">
Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>

<br>

It is written in the gospel of our Savior that the servant, who knows
his master’s will and is not prepared to do it, will suffer greatly at
the greatly at the hands of justice; but he who does not know will
suffer greatly at the hands of justice; but he who does not know will
suffer greatly, because he will not know will suffer greatly, because
he will not know the will of his master. And us, who know your will and
do not do it, you will deliver into the hands of a justice, which is
more severe than that of the kings of the earth. In your mercy save us,
as you saved David from Saul, hallelulia, and have mercy on us. <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
B’outho of Mar Jacob</span><br>

<br>

We call upon you, Lord our Lord, come to our help; hear our petition and have mercy on our souls. <br>

<br>

The sinner is loved when his face is bathed in tears and his mouth is
closed by sorrowful mourning full of pain; precious gems are not so
much loved as the drops which flow from the eyes of him who repents. <br>

<br>

If you wish to paint a picture of repentance, you will not mix good
colors except with tears. Tears are a great feast of repentance, bring
them and come and enjoy forgiveness. <br>

<br>

Answer, Lord, answer, Lord, and have mercy upon us; and turn the hearts of the sons of men to repentance. <br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">
Kurielaison, Kurielaison, Kurielaison, </span><br>

<br>

He sits under the protection of the Most High, and glories in the shelter of God.<br>

<br>

I said to the Lord, my trust is in your, God is my refuge in whom I trust.<br>

<br>

He shall deliver you from the snare which makes you stumble, and from talk of vain things.<br>

<br>

He will keep you safe under his feathers and you shall be protected beneath his wings, his truth shall enclose you as an armor.<br>

<br>

You shall not be afraid of the terror of the night, or of the arrow which flies by day.<br>

<br>

Of the word which walks in the darkness, or of the spirit that wastes at midday.<br>

<br>

Thousands shall fall at your side and ten thousand at your right hand<br>

<br>

But it shall not come near to you, but with your eyes alone you shall see.<br>

<br>

You shall see the reward of the wicked, because you, Lord are my trust.<br>

<br>

You have made your dwelling I the heights, evil shall not come near you.<br>

<br>

Affliction shall not come near your tent, because he has commanded his angels concerning you.<br>

<br>

That they should keep you in all your ways, and receive you in their arms;<br>

<br>

That you may not stumble with your foot, you shall tread upon the asp and the basilisk<br>

<br>

You shall tread upon the lion and the dragon, because he has cried to me, I will deliver him and strengthen him.<br>

<br>

Because he has known my name he shall call upon me and I will answer him, I will be with him in distress. <br>

<br>

I will strengthen him and honor him; I will satisfy him with length of days.<br>

<br>

I will show him my salvation; I have lifted up my eyes to the hills.<br>

<br>

From whence will come my help, my help is from the Lord,<br>

<br>

Who made heaven and earth, he will not suffer your foot to slip.<br>

<br>

Your guardian shall not sleep, indeed he neither slumbers no sleeps.<br>

<br>

The guardian of Israel, the Lord is your guardian.<br>

<br>

The Lord shall shelter you with his right hand, by day the sun shall not harm you,<br>

<br>

Nor the moon by night, the Lord shall guard you from all evil.<br>

<br>

The Lord shall guard your soul, he shall guard your going out and coming in.<br>

<br>

From henceforth and forever more.<br>

<br>

And to you belongs the praise, O God, Barekmor.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">
Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">
Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>

Prayer of St. Severus </span><br>

<br>

He dwells under the protection of the Most High, beneath the shadow of the wings of your loving kindness.<br>

<br>

Protect us, Lord, and have mercy upon us; you who hear all, hear the prayer of servants in your loving kindness. <br>

<br>

An evening full of peace and a night of holiness, grant us, Christ our Savior, for you are the king of glory.<br>

<br>

To you our eyes are turned, pardon our offences and our sins; in this world and in the world to come, have mercy on us.<br>

<br>

Lord let your mercy protect us and your grace rest upon our faces, let your cross guard us from the evil on and his powers.<br>

<br>

May your right hand rest upon us all the days of our life, and your
peace reign among us and give hope and salvation to the souls of those
who pray to you.<br>

<br>

By the prayers of Mary who bore you and of all the saints, pardon me, Lord, and have mercy upon me, O God.<br>
