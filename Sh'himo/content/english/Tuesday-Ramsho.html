<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lord's Prayer</span><br>
<br>
Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread: and forgive us our debts and sins, as we also have
forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
the evil one. For Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory,
forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hail Mary</span><br>
<br>
Hail, Mary, full of Grace, our Lord is with thee; blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, our Lord Jesus
Christ. Oh Virgin Saint Mary, Oh Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at all times, and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Introductory Prayer of Ramsho</span><br>
<br>
Grant us, Lord god, that while our bodies rest from the labors of the
day and our souls are released from worldly thoughts, we may stand in
your presence with tranquility at this time of evening and that we may
offer you ceaseless praise and uninterrupted thanksgiving; that we may
acknowledge your loving kindness by which you direct and rule our
lives, and protect and save our souls; to you we offer praise and
thanksgiving, now and always and forever. Amen<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Psalms of Ramsho (Ps. 141, 142, 119:105-112, 117)</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Kurielaison</span> Lord, I have called upon you, answer me: hear and receive my words.<br>
<br>
Let my prayer be like incense in your sight, the offering of my hands
like the evening offering.&nbsp; Set a guard, Lord, before my mouth, a
guard before my lips that my heart may not turn to evil words and I may
not do deeds of wickedness.<br>
<br>
Let me not take salt with impious men; let the just man teach me and
reprove me: let not the oil of the impious anoint my head; because my
prayer was against their evil-doing: their judges have been restrained
by the side of the rock; and they have heard how gentle are my words. <br>
<br>
As when a plough cleaves the earth their bones have been scattered at
the mouth of Sheol.&nbsp; I have lifted my eyes to you, Lord, and in
you have I put my trust, do not cast away my soul.<br>
<br>
Keep me from the hand of the proud, who have laid snares for me; let the wicked fall into their nets, while I pass on.<br>
With my voice I cried to the Lord; with my voice I besought the Lord
and poured my prayer before him; I showed him my affliction, when my
spirit was troubled, but you know my path.<br>
In the way of my walking they have laid a snare for me; I look to the
right and see none that knows me: the way of escape has gone from me
and there is none who cares for my soul, I cried to you, Lord, and
said: you are my hope and my portion in the land of the living.<br>
<br>
Hear my petition because I am brought very low; deliver me from my
persecutors because they are too strong for me.&nbsp; Lead me forth
from prison that I may give thanks to your name: your just ones shall
have hope when you shall reward me.<br>
<br>
Your word is a lamp to my feet and light to my path; I have sworn and
am resolved to keep the judgments of your justice.&nbsp; I am greatly
brought low, Lord, give me life according to your word; be pleased with
the words of my mouth, Lord, and teach me your judgments.<br>
<br>
My soul is ever in my hands, and I have no forgotten your law; sinners
have laid snares for me and I have not strayed from your
commands.&nbsp; I shall inherit your testimony forever because it is
dear to my heart; I have turned my heart to do your commands forever in
truth.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Praise the Lord, all you nations; praise him, all you peoples; for his grace is strong over us, truly the Lord is forever.<br>
<br>
And to you belongs the praise, O God. Barekmor.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Eqbo</span><br>
<br>
Incline your ear in mercy, Lord and answer and hear the voice of my
prayer; be pleased to receive in your kindness our service and our
prayers. Stoumen Kalos, Kurielaison<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Qolo</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">In heaven and own Earth.</span><br>
Accept, Lord, this incense from our hands like the incense of Aaron which kept death away from the people.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
Glory to you, Son, who are seated at the right hand; while the Watchers and the angels cry, holy, holy, to you.<br>
<br>
My mouth is not sufficient to tell the story of your praises, holy virgin, Mary, Theotokos.<br>
<br>
The Chariot of the Cherubim cannot be compared with you, Virgin Mary, Theotokos.<br>
<br>
At all time we remember the prophets and apostles with the blessed martyrs; may their prayers be a stronghold to us.<br>
<br>
Martyrs, who passed by the bridge of fire to the heights, pray that we may not drown in the tumultuous sea of sin.<br>
<br>
Repent, repent, sinners, said our Lord; that when the bridegroom appears you may enter the marriage-chamber with him.<br>
<br>
Grant me and make me worthy on the day when your mercy appears, that I may stand and praise you in the company of your saints.<br>
<br>
On your right hand, Lord, at your coming make to stand all the departed who have confessed the Trinity. <br>
<br>
Christ, who raised Lazarus of Bethany, raise the departed purchased by your precious blood.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Lord God my salvation.</span><br>
Be to my soul a guardian, Lord God, because I walk among the snares of
pleasure every day; deliver my soul from faults and save me by your
grace, for you are a lover of men.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
Praise to you, Lord, from those above whom you fashioned for your glory
and from those below whom you created in the image of your majesty;
heaven and earth shall praise you, and sea and land and all that is in
them, because you are he that created them.<br>
<br>
Gabriel flew on the wings of the spirit and came to Mary and gave her
the greeting of peace which was sent to her, and thus he spoke to her.
Peace be with you, the Lord is with you, and from you shall come forth
the Savior of the whole creation.<br>
Isaiah, the son of Amos, cried and prophesied about your child, pure
virgin, you who bore the eagle, who is the ancient of days, and in your
virginity you brought forth Emmanuel, God who became man.<br>
<br>
Blessed is he, who built the holy Church on the palm of his hands, and
placed as its foundations the prophets, apostles and holy martyrs and
assembled and filled her with all peoples; and behold, they offer
praise in her by night and by day. <br>
<br>
You blessed martyrs, who were slain for our Savior, and whose blood
rose like precious incense before the throne of Christ; pray to your
Lord that he may make his peace and tranquility rest on the four
quarters of the world.<br>
<br>
You are a good example, Mar (X), to all who look upon you, of watching
and fasting and praying by night and by day; let everyone imitate you,
who seeks to be enriched by the Good one, whose treasure house lies
open.<br>
<br>
You are blessed, O Church, to whom the word of the Son is a protection,
and the bars of Sheol shall not prevail against you henceforth forever.
He gave you his flesh to eat and his blood, the chalice of salvation,
in pardon for your children.<br>
<br>
Behold, I knock at the door of your mercy, that I may receive
forgiveness; for the evil one by his craft has kept me from the path of
life and has kept my mouth from praise and my feet from the holy
temple; have pity, you who are a lover of men.<br>
<br>
Splendor of the Father, enlighten my eyes that I may give thanks for
your grace; I like in darkness in this world full of deceit; the
morning has passed and I do not repent; the evening has come and my
offences have increased, may your compassion stand before my face.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Of all the departed who descended to be clothed in you in baptism, who
ate your flesh and drank your blood and slept in your hope, make
memory, Lord, here and above in heaven, and give rest to their spirits.<br>
<br>
Adam, Adam, do not be grieved because you transgressed the command; for
with one word I will call you and you shall rise and stand and shall
sing praise and thanksgiving to the Father, the Son and the Holy
Spirit, the threefold mystery.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Quqlion</span><br>
<br>
Bless the Lord, my soul, halleluia, and all my bones bless his holy name.<br>
<br>
Who forgives you all your iniquity, halleluia and heals all your diseases.<br>

<br>
The wicked cry from the midst of the fire like the rich man; they ask
for a drop of water an none gives what they ask; greater is your
compassion than our iniquity, O Good one and Son of the Good; do not
allow the fire that lasts for ever to lay hold on your image. <span style="font-style: italic;">Stomen Kalos, Kurielaison.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Qolo</span><br>
<br>
Blessed is he who has given us an evening of peace and a night of
repose, when the weary laborers rest and offer praise to the Father who
created us in his compassion, to the Son who redeemed us by his cross
and to the Holy Spirit.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
Take up your harps, my brothers, and sing praise, as David the king
took his harp inspired by the Holy Spirit; beg of our Lord in prayer
that he may make his calm and peace dwell in the four quarters of the
earth.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">B’outho of Mar Jacob</span><br>
<br>
We call upon you, Lord our Lord, come to our help; hear our petition and have mercy on our souls.<br>
<br>
The Son of God will come to judgment and to trial. Who will not be
afraid of the dread judge when he comes? He judges by fire and has a
rod of flame, and by fire he separates the just from the wicked.<br>
<br>
He will try the whole world like gold in a crucible; and where the fire
finds any impurity, it begins to burn it. Be in fear, my brethren, of
this coming of the Son of God; let every man hasten to take refuge in
repentance.<br>
<br>
Christ the king, before whom the defects of my being are revealed; in the hour when you judge me, have mercy on me.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Concluding Prayer&nbsp; of Ramsho</span><br>
<br>
O Jesus Christ our Lord, close not the door of Thy mercy upon our
faces.&nbsp; We confess that we are sinners; have mercy upon us.&nbsp;
O Lord, Thy love for us, didst make Thee to come down to us from Thy
place.&nbsp; That by Thy death, our death might be abolished; Have
mercy upon us. Amen.<br>
