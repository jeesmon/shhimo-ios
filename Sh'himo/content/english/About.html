The MGOCSM of North America, the youth ministry of the Malankara
Orthodox Syrian Church, makes the beautiful prayers of the West Syriac
Tradition available to our faithful in North America and worldwide. It
is our hope, these prayers which are made available, will instill the
discipline of prayer in the lives of all our faithful, to make them
strong, witnessing Orthodox Christians. The liturgical prayers for all
liturgical offices from Monday to Saturday are included in this
app.&nbsp; The prayers of Sunday are not included, as it is the
practice for Orthodox Christians to pray the liturgical hours of Sunday
with the worshipping community.<br>

<br>

May the power of the sacred prayers of the Holy Church, help us in our
journey to the Kingdom of God.<br>
