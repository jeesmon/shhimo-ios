<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lord's Prayer</span><br>
<br>
Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread: and forgive us our debts and sins, as we also have
forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
the evil one. For Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory,
forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hail Mary</span><br>
<br>
Hail, Mary, full of Grace, our Lord is with thee; blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, our Lord Jesus
Christ. Oh Virgin Saint Mary, Oh Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at all times, and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Introductory Prayer of Sapro</span><br>
<br>
Creator of the morning, who drive out the darkness and bring light and
joy to the creation; create in us habits of virtue and drive from us
all the darkness of sin; give us light and joy by the glorious rays of
your grace, Lord our God, forever. Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Psalms 51</span><br>
<br>
Have mercy on me, God, in your loving kindness; in the abundance of your mercy blot out my sin.<br>
<br>
Wash me thoroughly from my guilt and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my fault and my sins are before me always.<br>
<br>
Against you only have I sinned and done evil in your sight, that you
may be justified in your words and vindicated in your judgment. For I
was born in guilt and in sin did my mother conceive me.<br>
<br>
But you take pleasure in truth and you have made known to me the
secrets of your wisdom. Sprinkle me with your hyssop and I shall be
clean; wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.<br>
<br>
Give me the comfort of your joy and gladness, and the bones which have
been humbled shall rejoice. Turn away your face from my sins and blot
out all my faults.<br>
<br>
Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew your steadfast spirit
within me. Do not cast me from your presence and take not your Holy
Spirit from me. <br>
But restore to me your joy and your salvation and let your glorious
spirit sustain me; that I may teach the wicked your way and sinners may
return to you.<br>
<br>
Deliver me from blood, O God, God of my salvation, and my tongue
shall praise your justice.&nbsp; Lord , open my lips and my mouth shall
sing your praise.<br>
<br>
For you do not take pleasure in sacrifices; by burnt offerings you are
not appeased. The sacrifice of God is a humble spirit, a heart that is
contrite will not despise.<br>
<br>
Do good in your good pleasure to Zion and build up the walls of
Jerusalem. Then shall you be satisfied with sacrifices of truth and
with whole burnt-offerings; then shall they offer bullocks upon your
altar.<br>
<br>
And to you belongs the praise, O God, Barekmor.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Psalm 63</span><br>
<br>
My God, you are my God, I will seek you.<br>
<br>
My soul thirsts for you and my flesh seeks for you like the thirsty earth which is parched and begging for water.<br>
<br>
So have I looked for you in truth, that I may see your power and your glory.<br>
<br>
Because your loving kindness is better than life and my lips shall praise you.<br>
<br>
So I will bless you while I live and will lift up my hands in your name.<br>
<br>
My soul shall be enriched as with marrow and fat and my mouth shall praise you with lips of praise.<br>
<br>
I have remembered you upon my bed and in the night time I have meditated on you.<br>
<br>
For you have been my helper and in the shadow of your wings is my protection.<br>
<br>
My soul follows after you and your right hand upholds me.<br>
<br>
Those who seek to destroy my soul shall enter into the lower parts of the earth.<br>
<br>
They shall be delivered over to the sword and shall be food for foxes; but the king shall rejoice in God.<br>
<br>
Everyone who swears by him shall glory, but the mouth of those who speak lies shall be stopped.<br>
<br>
And to you belongs the praise, O God, Barekmor.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>

<br>
</span>I come before you and I pray and beseech you to forgive my
fault; you are a merciful God, have compassion on my sin and have pity
on me.<br>
<br>
Because there is not in the world another sinner like to me, who have
sinned greatly and angered you, by prayer I appease you; have
compassion on my sin and have pity on me.<br>
<br>
Because I sink in the multitude of sins as in a sea, Lord of all, draw
me from them by your grace; have compassion on my sin and have pity on
me.<br>
<br>
Because from the womb of my mother you are my God, do not go far from
me, sang David the son of Jesse; Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger,
have compassion on my sin and have pity of me.<br>
<br>
Because I am like that servant who did not trade with the talent, which
was entrusted to him by his Lord, count me with him who had ten
talents; have compassion on my sin and have pity on me.<br>
<br>
Because I am like that fig-tree, which did not give fruit in its
season, and you ordered it to be cut down; fruit who came forth from
Mary, have compassion on my sin and have pity on me.<br>
<br>
Because the publican called on you and the thief and the sinful woman,
and you answered them, O God, I also call upon you; have compassion on
my sin and have pity on me.<br>
<br>
Because David sang in the fifty first psalm, have mercy on me, O God,
wash me more abundantly from iniquity; have compassion on my sin and
have pity on me.<br>
<br>
Because my offenses are many and my faults have gone over my head, I
beseech you, compassionate one pardon them by your grace; have
compassion on my sin and have pity on me. <br>
<br>
Because Adam transgressed the command of his creator, death reigned
over him and his children; Good one, who were moved to mercy and
descended and redeemed him, have compassion on my sin and have pity on
me.<br>
<br>
Because the whole creation comes before you and worships and praises
and knocks at your door; compassionate one, answer in the abundance of
your grace, have compassion on my sin and have pity on me.<br>
<br>
Because the dead within the grave wait for you, that you may come and
raise up their bodies, call them by your voice and make them rise from
the grave to Paradise. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
Because the powers of heaven sing praise to you, and we upon earth
offer praise with them to your godhead, have compassion on my sin and
have pity on me.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Psalm 113</span><br>
<br>
Praise, you servants of the Lord, praise the name of the Lord.<br>
<br>
May the Lord's name be blessed forever and forever.<br>
<br>
From the rising of the sun to its setting great is the name of the Lord.<br>
<br>
The Lord is high above all peoples and his glory is above the heavens.<br>
<br>
Who is like the Lord, our God, who sits on high and looks upon the depths in heaven and on earth?<br>
<br>
He raises up the poor from the dunghill, and makes him sit with the princes of the people.<br>
<br>
He makes the barren woman keep house and be a joyful mother of children. <br>
<br>
And to you belongs the praise, O God, Barekmor.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

<br>
</span>O God, save me, for the storms and tempests of the sins, which I
have committed, surround me; be to me a harbor of peace, Lord, that I
may not be drowned in the sea of sin; I seek to repent, stretch out
your hand, Lord as you did to Peter, and have pity on me. Stomen Kalos,
Kurielaison.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Qolo<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-style: italic;">May your prayers be a stronghold to us.</span><br>
The just men of old offered a pure incense to your loving-kindness;
Phineas arose and prayed and held back death and Aaron the priest by
his incense made atonement for the people and appeased God.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br>
Every morning glory to him who by a gesture ruled the creation; earth
and heaven are filled with him and are too small for him, but the heart
of the just is large enough for him; blessed is he who at every hour
worships him.<br>
<br>
O Solomon, fair child, what is that garden of which you sang, which was
closed and sealed in its virginity; it is Mary from whom came forth the
gardener who planted Paradise. <br>
<br>
Peace be with you, full of grace, said the Watcher to the virgin; the
Lord is with you and shall come forth from you in a holy manner, the
king whose kingdom shall have no end forever.<br>
<br>
In the morning the Son of the King went forth to hire laborers for the
vineyard of his Father’s house; he hired first the prophets and the
apostles, and at the eleventh hour the thief, and he gave him the key
and sent him to Paradise. <br>
<br>
Blessed are you, holy ones, our Lord said, blessed are you, because you
hated this world and its pleasures, and behold there is kept for you on
high the marriage-chamber and the garden and the table of the kingdom.<br>
<br>
In the morning came the merchants of Midian and drew up from the pit
the young man Joseph, the son of Rachel, and paid the price and took
him and went from there to the land of Egypt and there he became king.<br>
<br>
At your door, Lord, I knock, and from your treasure-house I beg for
mercy; I am a sinner who for years have departed from your way; grant
me to confess my sins and be free from them and live in your grace.<br>
<br>
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, be to us a high wall and a house of
refuge from the evil one and his powers who fight with us; under the
wings of your mercy protect us when the good are separated from the
wicked. <br>
<br>
Make a good memory, Lord, of the pastors, who tended your flock, of the
prophets, apostles, and martyrs, the just and the priests and all the
children of the Church from age to age and for evermore.<br>
<br>
O Good one, full of mercy, let not your servants, who worshipped you,
be judged and do not enter into judgment with them on the day of
visitation, because no man living is justified before the dread
judgment seat. <br>

</span><span style="font-style: italic;">Our Lord Jesus Christ.</span><br>
In the morning the disciples saw the Lord of the seas on the sea and in
the morning the Watcher, who never sleeps slept in the boat, and in the
morning he shall call the just: come and receive the reward of your
labors.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
In the morning the churches sing praise; in the morning the monasteries
make a joyful noise; in the morning the tongues of beasts and birds
sound; in the morning the sea worships you and the islands and their
inhabitants. <br>
<br>
He who makes the rain pour from the clouds and sprinkles the earth with
showers, sucked drops of milk from the breast of the virgin Mary, and
wonder filled his mother, when she bore and carried him.<br>
<br>
Behold, he is lulled like a baby, the infant who is older than the
ages; and behold, he leaps like a child before whom John leapt at
meeting with him; and behold, he is carried in the arms, the elder who
is the ancient of days.<br>
<br>
Peace be with the prophets peace be with the apostles, peace be with
the martyrs, who loved the Lord of peace, and peace be with the holy
Church, in which dwell the sons of peace. <br>
<br>
It was not alone, you martyrs, that you entered the arena, for your
Lord entered with you and gave courage to your minds, because he saw
your true love, and he honored and magnified your memory.<br>
<br>
You acquired pinions and swift wings, our father, Mar (X); with the
pinions you will receive your reward and with wings you will fly to the
heights, and you shall go forth to meet your Lord in the perfection of
your way of life. <br>
<br>
In the morning the faithful Shamouni offered prayer to God; God, give
judgment for me before the king Antiochus, who slays my sons like sheep
and rushed upon me like a lion. <br>
Our God have mercy upon us, as your grace is wont, and drive the enemy
from us who at every hour lays snares for us; may your cross be our
guard and by it may we be protected from him. <br>
<br>
Do not chastise the world with afflictions because we have sinned; for
the sake of the prophets and apostles and for the sake of the holy
martyrs have mercy on your flock, Son, who are like your Father in all
things. <br>
<br>
On the altars in the four quarters of the earth make memory, our
Savior, of all who ate your flesh and blood and confessed your passion;
keep the living by your cross and pardon the dead in your mercy.<br>
<br>
When the sea of fire roars and consumes the impious in wrath, may our
fathers and brothers, who have slept and who confessed the Trinity, be
raised by the sweet sound of your living voice to your right hand. <br>

</span>To you, Lord, I have lifted up my soul, halleluia and halleluia, O God, in you I have trusted, do not let me be put to shame.<br>
<br>
Let the wicked be but to shame in their vanity, halleluia and halleluia, show me, Lord, your ways. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

</span>The light, Lord, worships you, the companies of heaven praise
you; and all creation worships you in the morning, when your light
appears. <span style="font-style: italic;">Stomen Kalos, Kurieleison</span><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Qolo<br>
<br>
</span>In the morning Jacob, the just, was awakened from his sleep and
marveled at the ladder, which was set upon the earth and its head
reached to heaven, and the angels and the Watchers of the heights
ascend upon it and are carried up on high.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
In the morning Simon Peter cried: bid me, Lord, come to you; and your
Lord answered and said to him; walk upon the waves and do not be
afraid, for everyone who believes in me has no fear on sea or on land.<br>
<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">B’outho of Mar Jacob</span><br>
<br>
Open to us, Lord, your great door, full of mercy; hear our prayer and have mercy on our souls. <br>
<br>
The Lord loves prayer in secret in the inner chamber; it is not by loud
cries that the just won their victories; the prayer of Moses and his
humility divided the sea and the people passed over, and Pharaoh was
drowned because he was proud.<br>
<br>
God heard the prayer of David and had mercy on him and passed over his
transgression and gave back to him the gift of prophecy; Hananiah and
his companions called upon God in the furnace and he delivered them
from the burning of the flames. <br>
<br>
There are three things, Lord, which make me tremble and terrify me, the hour of death, the dread judgment seat and Gehenna. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Conclusion<br>
<br>
</span>It is good to give thanks to the Lord and to sing praise to your
name Most High; to proclaim in the morning your loving kindness and
your faithfulness in the night. Lord, in the morning you shall hear my
voice and in the morning I have prepared myself to appear before you.
Lord, I have compassion on your people, Lord, pardon and forgive the
sins of us all. Holy one, let your right hand rest upon us and pardon
our infirmity, because your name is forever.<br>
