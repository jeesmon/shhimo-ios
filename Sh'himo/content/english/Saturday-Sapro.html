<br>
Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread: and forgive us our debts and sins, as we also have
forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
the evil one. For Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory,
forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hail Mary</span><br>
<br>
Hail, Mary, full of Grace, our Lord is with thee; blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, our Lord Jesus
Christ. Oh Virgin Saint Mary, Oh Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at all times, and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Introductory Prayer of Sapro</span><br>
<br>
Creator of the morning, who drive out the darkness and bring light and
joy to the creation; create in us habits of virtue and drive from us
all the darkness of sin; give us light and joy by the glorious rays of
your grace, Lord our God, forever. Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Psalms 51</span><br>
<br>
Have mercy on me, God, in your loving kindness; in the abundance of your mercy blot out my sin.<br>
<br>
Wash me thoroughly from my guilt and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my fault and my sins are before me always.<br>
<br>
Against you only have I sinned and done evil in your sight, that you
may be justified in your words and vindicated in your judgment. For I
was born in guilt and in sin did my mother conceive me.<br>
<br>
But you take pleasure in truth and you have made known to me the
secrets of your wisdom. Sprinkle me with your hyssop and I shall be
clean; wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.<br>
<br>
Give me the comfort of your joy and gladness, and the bones which have
been humbled shall rejoice. Turn away your face from my sins and blot
out all my faults.<br>
<br>
Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew your steadfast spirit
within me. Do not cast me from your presence and take not your Holy
Spirit from me. <br>
But restore to me your joy and your salvation and let your glorious
spirit sustain me; that I may teach the wicked your way and sinners may
return to you.<br>
<br>
Deliver me from blood, O God, God of my salvation, and my tongue
shall praise your justice.&nbsp; Lord , open my lips and my mouth shall
sing your praise.<br>
<br>
For you do not take pleasure in sacrifices; by burnt offerings you are
not appeased. The sacrifice of God is a humble spirit, a heart that is
contrite&nbsp;&nbsp; will not despise.<br>
<br>
Do good in your good pleasure to Zion and build up the walls of
Jerusalem. Then shall you be satisfied with sacrifices of truth and
with whole burnt-offerings; then shall they offer bullocks upon your
altar. And to you belongs the praise, O God.<br>
<br>
And to you belongs the praise, O God, Barekmor.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Psalm 63</span><br>
<br>
My God, you are my God, I will seek you.<br>
<br>
My soul thirsts for you and my flesh seeks for you like the thirsty earth which is parched and begging for water.<br>
<br>
So have I looked for you in truth, that I may see your power and your glory.<br>
<br>
Because your loving kindness is better than life and my lips shall praise you.<br>
<br>
So I will bless you while I live and will lift up my hands in your name.<br>
<br>
My soul shall be enriched as with marrow and fat and my mouth shall praise you with lips of praise.<br>
<br>
I have remembered you upon my bed and in the night time I have meditated on you.<br>
<br>
For you have been my helper and in the shadow of your wings is my protection.<br>
<br>
My soul follows after you and your right hand upholds me.<br>
<br>
Those who seek to destroy my soul shall enter into the lower parts of the earth.<br>
<br>
They shall be delivered over to the sword and shall be food for foxes; but the king shall rejoice in God.<br>
<br>
Everyone who swears by him shall glory, but the mouth of those who speak lies shall be stopped.<br>
<br>
And to you belongs the praise, O God, Barekmor.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>

<br>
</span>Do not enter into judgment with your servants, Lord, to whom you have given your body and blood as a pledge.<br>
<br>
Grant us and make us worthy to hear that voice: come, enter, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom.<br>
<br>
May the memory of Mary be a blessing to us and may; prayer be a stronghold for our souls.<br>
<br>
Behold a sweet scent breathes upon the air for the virgin Mary, mother of God. <br>
<br>
Prophets, apostles and holy martyrs beg for mercy for us all. <br>
<br>
Blessed are the prophets, blessed are the apostles, blessed are the martyrs on the day of resurrection.<br>
<br>
Let us beg the martyrs and beseech them that they may be intercessors for us.<br>
The martyrs, who desired to see Christ, obtained wings by the sword and flew to the heights.<br>
<br>
Have mercy on us, just judge, and forgive us our offences in the abundance of your grace.<br>
<br>
O just judge, who judge with justice, do not make us enter into judgment and do not remember our offences.<br>
<br>
When there is no comforter or friend to deliver, then be to me, Lord, an advocate because I have taken refuge in you.<br>
<br>
Give rest and pardon, Lord, to our departed, who rest in your hope, and await your coming.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
Glory to him who magnifies the memory of his mother and glorifies his saints and raises the dead.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Psalm 113</span><br>
<br>
Praise, you servants of the Lord, praise the name of the Lord.<br>
<br>
May the Lord's name be blessed forever and forever.<br>
<br>
From the rising of the sun to its setting great is the name of the Lord.<br>
<br>
The Lord is high above all peoples and his glory is above the heavens.<br>
<br>
Who is like the Lord, our God, who sits on high and looks upon the depths in heaven and on earth?<br>
<br>
He raises up the poor from the dunghill, and makes him sit with the princes of the people.<br>
<br>
He makes the barren woman keep house and be a joyful mother of children. <br>
<br>
And to you belongs the praise, O God, Barekmor.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>

By the smoke of incense, which is offered and which the priests present
the Church of the faithful makes memory of the departed; may peace of
the Father reign in her and the evil on be cast down and her children
will offer you praise because you are their resurrection.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

Glory to you, Lord, at whose voice Lazarus, the brother of Mary and
Martha, arose after he was corrupted; and at your entrance the daughter
of Jairus was awakened; and at the sound of the last voice, with which
you will call, the dead will rise.<br>
<br>
Without pen and without ink Gabriel brought a letter full of peace and
came to Mary, and said to her: peace be with you, the Lord is with you
and shall come forth from you, the Savior of the whole creation.<br>
<br>
The rock which brought forth streams in the desert was clearly a figure
of you, holy virgin, from whom came forth in the creation the Son of
God, who is the true rock, as Paul said.<br>
<br>
On that rock of the house of Simon, the head of the apostles, I am
built and l am not afraid, the Church answered and said; the waves and
tempests beat against me but they do not shake me; the accursed
Nestorius fought against me and received a fall.<br>
<br>
O you martyrs, why did you despise this passing world, which all men
love? Because we saw that it is deceitful in its pleasures, and that it
has hated from the beginning to the end those who love it. <br>
<br>
All the earth has not sinned against you as I have sinned, and all the
proud have not angered you as I have angered you; my life is short and
death approaches and what shall I do ? By the love which sent you to
us, pardon my offences.<br>
<br>
There will be weeping for sinners at the seat of judgment, when their
actions are examined as in the light of the sun; judgment without mercy
will come forth from the judge and there is no acceptance of persons
there and he does not take a bribe.<br>
<br>
The wise creator in in his wisdom has bound the whole world beneath the
yoke of death; he removes exalted kings from their places and mighty
judges from their seats. <br>
<br>
Our Lord came to Bethany to visit his friend, and he found him laid
four days in the grave; he called to him with his voice and raised him
up and said to him: I am the Son of God, who make to die and make to
die and make to live<br>

</span>The servants who did the will of the Lord.<br>
In the morning the laborers of our Lord, who have worked in his
vineyard, will ask for their wages, and say to him: give us our wages,
who have labored from morning to evening; he will say to them: I will
give you what I promised you, and I will add yet more; I will give you
an open face at the resurrection.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
Glory to the first-born Son, who descended to Sheol and conquered
death; Adam saw him and was comforted and bowed his head and worshipped
before him and said to him: forgive me my fault and let me go forth
from here, Lord, and restore me and my children to the Paradise from
which I departed.<br>
<br>
The spirit of fire rent the flames and trod upon the coals amid the
wheels of the chariot and left the air, when he descended and came to
Nazareth to Mary, and said to her: peace be with you, our Lord is with
you, blessed one, the fruit of your womb shall bring to an end the
shame of the house of Adam.<br>
<br>
By the prayer and the petition of the holy virgin Mary, keep from us,
Son of God, the scourge and the rod of wrath; grant us months of joy
and years of abundance, and may our service and our prayers be to your
satisfaction.<br>
<br>
Come, let us take refuge in the apostles, who by their afflictions were
pleasing to Christ and from him received the Holy Spirit and the keys
of the heights and the depths; blessed is he, who magnified them on
earth and made them preachers and, behold, today their memories are
celebrated in the creation.<br>
<br>
The martyrs say to the judges, we have a Lord in heaven above;
thousands and thousands and myriads and myriads of angels stand before
him; we will not deny his truth, because there is no other Lord apart
from him and he will give judgment for the oppressed against their
oppressors.<br>
<br>
Blessed is he who perfected your martyrdom and wove a crown of victory
for you, O noble athlete, holy Mar (X); behold, the heights and the
depths and all that is in them rejoice in your memory and offer praise
to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.<br>
<br>
Open to me the door of your compassion, cried the penitent son before
his father; I have sinned against heaven and in your sight and I am not
worthy to be called your son; receive me as a hired servant and I will
be in your house as a slave, and forgive me my fault, for you are a
merciful God.<br>
<br>
Our times are like ourselves and the generation, in which we live,
resembles us; the rich love avarice and the poor lies, and like a
serpent, which devours his fellow, men devour one another; and they do
not place the judgment of God before their eyes.<br>
Blessed is he who has magnified our resurrection and made firm the hope
of our rising again; the blessed Paul is witness, when he refutes the
doubter and says: foolish man, the seed which you sow, if it does not
die, does not live; and he showed that the race of Adam shall rise in
glory.<br>
<br>
Make memory, Lord, of the departed who took your body and your living
blood and received pardon through it, in the Jerusalem which is in
heaven; and when you sit on your throne and divide the good from the
evil, let them stand, Lord, with faces unveiled at your right hand.<br>

</span>Your priests shall be clothed with righteousness and Your saints

</span>God created Adam and sat down and contemplated him, and saw how
fair he was and how like the creature was to his creator. The earthly
one came and went among the trees of Paradise and the angels wondered
at the earthly one to see how he was exalted.<br>

When the priesthood was handed down, Moses and Aaron received it
together; Moses gave it to Zachariah, Zachariah gave it to John, John
gave it to our Lord, and our Lord gave it to the apostles; the apostles
gave it to the four quarters of the creation.<br>

Christ the bridegroom, call your servants from desolation and awaken
your priests; because they took no pleasure in passing joys, reward
them with good things for the torments which they endured for your love.<br>

Because they were strangers, let them be refreshed in the
marriage-chamber of light full of joy; the fair crown of youth they
despised and put away and they set their souls firm against pleasures
and loved your name.<br>

Lord, let us not hear that, voice, which cuts oft hope; we have
acknowledged you, Lord, do you acknowledge us and have mercy upon us.<br>

</span>It is good to give thanks to the Lord and to sing praise to your
name Most High; to proclaim in the morning your loving kindness and
your faithfulness in the night. Lord, in the morning you shall hear my
voice and in the morning I have prepared myself to appear before you.
Lord, I have compassion on your people, Lord, pardon and forgive the
sins of us all. Holy one, let your right hand rest upon us and pardon
our infirmity, because your name is forever.<br>
