Lord's Prayer</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">



<br>



Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread: and forgive us our debts and sins, as we also have
forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
the evil one. For Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory,
forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.<br>



<br>

Hail Mary</span><br>



<br>



Hail, Mary, full of Grace, our Lord is with thee; blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, our Lord Jesus
Christ. Oh Virgin Saint Mary, Oh Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at all times, and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br>

Introductory Prayer of Sapro</span><br>



<br>



Creator of the morning, who drive out the darkness and bring light and
joy to the creation; create in us habits of virtue and drive from us
all the darkness of sin; give us light and joy by the glorious rays of
your grace, Lord our God, forever. Amen.<br>



<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">


Psalms 51</span><br>



<br>



Have mercy on me, God, in your loving kindness; in the abundance of your mercy blot out my sin.<br>



<br>



Wash me thoroughly from my guilt and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my fault and my sins are before me always.<br>



<br>



Against you only have I sinned and done evil in your sight, that you
may be justified in your words and vindicated in your judgment. For I
was born in guilt and in sin did my mother conceive me.<br>



<br>



But you take pleasure in truth and you have made known to me the
secrets of your wisdom. Sprinkle me with your hyssop and I shall be
clean; wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.<br>



<br>



Give me the comfort of your joy and gladness, and the bones which have
been humbled shall rejoice. Turn away your face from my sins and blot
out all my faults.<br>



<br>



Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew your steadfast spirit
within me. Do not cast me from your presence and take not your Holy
Spirit from me. <br>



But restore to me your joy and your salvation and let your glorious
spirit sustain me; that I may teach the wicked your way and sinners may
return to you.<br>



<br>



Deliver me from blood, O God, God of my salvation, and my tongue
shall praise your justice.&nbsp; Lord , open my lips and my mouth shall sing
your praise.<br>



<br>



For you do not take pleasure in sacrifices; by burnt offerings you are
not appeased. The sacrifice of God is a humble spirit, a heart that is
contrite will not despise.<br>



<br>



Do good in your good pleasure to Zion and build up the walls of
Jerusalem. Then shall you be satisfied with sacrifices of truth and
with whole burnt-offerings; then shall they offer bullocks upon your
altar. And to you belongs the praise, O God.<br>



<br>



And to you belongs the praise, O God, Barekmor.<br>



<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">


Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

<span style="font-weight: bold;">


Psalm 63</span><br>



<br>



My God, you are my God, I will seek you.<br>



<br>



My soul thirsts for you and my flesh seeks for you like the thirsty earth which is parched and begging for water.<br>



<br>



So have I looked for you in truth, that I may see your power and your glory.<br>



<br>



Because your loving kindness is better than life and my lips shall praise you.<br>



<br>



So I will bless you while I live and will lift up my hands in your name.<br>



<br>



My soul shall be enriched as with marrow and fat and my mouth shall praise you with lips of praise.<br>



<br>



I have remembered you upon my bed and in the night time I have meditated on you.<br>



<br>



For you have been my helper and in the shadow of your wings is my protection.<br>



<br>



My soul follows after you and your right hand upholds me.<br>



<br>



Those who seek to destroy my soul shall enter into the lower parts of the earth.<br>



<br>



They shall be delivered over to the sword and shall be food for foxes; but the king shall rejoice in God.<br>



<br>



Everyone who swears by him shall glory, but the mouth of those who speak lies shall be stopped.<br>



<br>



And to you belongs the praise, O God, Barekmor.<br>



<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">


Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>



<br>



With the angels in heaven, who do not cease from praise, make us worthy to sing praise to you, Lord God.<br>



<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">


Psalm 113</span><br>



<br>



Praise, you servants of the Lord, praise the name of the Lord.<br>



<br>



May the Lord's name be blessed forever and forever.<br>



<br>



From the rising of the sun to its setting great is the name of the Lord.<br>



<br>



The Lord is high above all peoples and his glory is above the heavens.<br>



<br>



Who is like the Lord, our God, who sits on high and looks upon the depths in heaven and on earth?<br>



<br>



He raises up the poor from the dunghill, and makes him sit with the princes of the people.<br>



<br>



He makes the barren woman keep house and be a joyful mother of children. <br>



<br>



And to you belongs the praise, O God, Barekmor.<br>



<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">


Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Qolo</span><br>



<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">


Have mercy on me, Lord, have mercy on me.</span><br>



May the smoke of incense which we offer in your presence, Lord God, be
for the pardon of our offences and the forgiveness of our sins and on
the day when your mercy in manifested, make us to stand at your right
hand, living Son, who redeemed us by your cross.<br>



<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">


Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">


Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>



<br>



Glory to you, Lord, who being eternally with the Father, lowered your
majesty from the hidden heights above and became a man of your own
will; and healed the diseases and the sicknesses of the weak race of
Adam; glory to you and blessed be your honor.<br>



<br>



The mountain of Sinai shook at your presence, Lord God; and the virgin
Mary carried you, who carry the heights and the depths. She conceived
you without marriage and brought you forth in a manner beyond
description; magnify, Lord, the memory of your mother.<br>



Virgin Mary, the messenger from above brought you a message of peace
and said: the king of kings shall dwell in you and you shall bear him
without marriage; blessed are you, blessed mother, who in your
virginity brought forth that sun which gives light to the creation.<br>



<br>



To the kingdom on high and life forever are the saints invited, that
which the ear has not heard and the eye of flesh has not seen and which
has not entered into the heart of men; great is the blessedness of
those who are worthy of it, the noble ones who loved Christ.<br>



<br>



The martyrs say: our crown awaits us and our recompense is kept tor us,
which the holy Son, whom we have loved, will give us as an inheritance
in his kingdom; for the torments, which we have suffered by the fire
and the sword, Christ will console us in the Paradise, which he
promised to those who love him.<br>



<br>



Christ the king, at the door of your compassion I knock at every hour,
and from your rich treasure house I ask tor compassion and mercy; in
you, Lord, I have taken refuge, help me; I have confessed you, do not
put me to shame; you are my hope and my strong protection.<br>



<br>



How narrow is the door and strait the way which leads to the kingdom;
he who wishes to go by it needs firmness, and he who relaxes a little
is drawn aside to the path of error; and he loses his soul of his own
will.<br>



<br>



Those who are sealed, with the seal of Christ in baptism, who ate his
holy body and drank his propitiatory blood, shall be raised by him from
the earth and shake off the dust and shall he clothed in a garment of
glory.<br>



<br>



Come, my beloved, let us all gather together with one consent in memory
of our fathers and brothers who ate his holy body and drank his
propitiatory blood, and loved him with all their hearts and rested in
the hope of Christ.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">


Light has arisen in the darkness for the upright</span><br>



At the time when the light appears and takes away the veil of darkness,
heaven and earth worship you, Lord, the pair who were made all at once,
the one a firmament above the waters and the other supporting the
waters, and the air was stretched between them, a bridal-chamber which
arose in the twinkling of an eye; glory to you, for your creation.<br>



<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">


Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">


Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>



<br>



Glory to the holy Father, who sent his holy Son and he descended and
dwelt in a pure and holy womb in a holy manner; he came in our image
and likeness, that we might become like him; he became a son of man
that he might make us sons of his Father and partakers of his Holy
Spirit.<br>



<br>



While Mary was standing in prayer and making supplication before God,
an angel of fire descended&nbsp; beside her, clothed in flame, and said to
her: peace be with you, palace in which the Son of the King dwells; he
took from you poverty, when he who is rich dwelt in your womb, that he
might satisfy the hunger of the nations.<br>



<br>



Blessed are you, Mary, who gave birth to the living Son of God; blessed
are you, precious vessel, in whom the merchant descended and dwelt;
blessed are you, palace of perfection, who received the architect of
the heights; you bore him and your virginity was preserved; you brought
him forth and remained pure; blessed is the Lord who came forth from
you.<br>



<br>



I am the true light, said our Lord to his disciples, and everyone who
walks in light the darkness shall not overtake. Blessed are the holy
apostles, who walked in the light of Christ; behold their memories are
celebrated from end to end of the earth; may their prayers be a
stronghold to us.<br>



<br>



The martyrs saw two paths, one leading to life, the other to death, and
they yearned for the narrow way that by it they might obtain the new
life; they descended into the conflict with the evil one; they
conquered him and ascended while they say: May the Lord's name be
blessed, for he is the friend of those who call upon him.<br>



<br>



The faithful Church shall rejoice in you, and shall sing praise in your
memory because you gave joy to Christ our God, holy Mar (X); he shall
give you joy in his kingdom with the just and righteous; give joy on
your holy festival to the congregation, which has celebrated your
memory, by visiting it with your help.<br>



God, who do not keep your mercy from sinners who approach you, keep and
remove from us in your compassion the scourge and rods of wrath; give
us months of joy and years of abundance and cast down the enemy before
us by the great sign of your cross; that we may give thanks to you for
your grace.<br>



<br>



I will not, Lord, cease from your praise and I will not desist from
singing hymns to you; do not judge me, Lord, with justice, because I
know that I am guilty and if you take vengeance on my offences, I shall
inherit Gehenna and I shall be cut off from life and I shall be silent
from prayer to you; in your mercy pardon my offences.<br>



<br>



Give rest and remembrance to our fathers and brothers who have fallen
asleep and set your worshippers in the companies and in the ranks of
your saints; when you sit on your seat of judgment and divide the good
from the evil, let them behold your compassion at the seat of judgment
and stand at your right hand on the day when your majesty appears.<br>



<br>



Christ our King and Savior, make memory of the departed who ate your
holy body and drank your precious blood, and give them joy in your
marriage-chamber and give them rest among your saints; let them sing
praise to you with the Watchers and the angels, who at all times give
praise to you.<br>

The rich among the people shall seek your race with offerings,

I will bless the Lord at all times and at all seasons.</span><br>



Blessed is Christ who chose you, Mary, daughter of David, from all
generations of the world, and took flesh from you and appeared on earth
as a son of man subject to passion, when he was God.&nbsp; Glory to Him who
so abased His majesty for our sakes, and magnified and exalted the
memory of His mother in the four quarters of the earth.<br>

Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">


Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>



<br>



Glory to you, God, the Word of life, who of your own will took flesh of
the blessed Mary, who was pure and holy in soul and in body; she
conceived you without marriage and brought you forth beyond all
telling; without the seed of man she conceived of the Holy Spirit.<br>

Make us share, Lord, in the memory of your mother and your saints; by their prayers have pity on us, Lord and on or departed.<br>



<br>



Blessed are you, Mary, for you were represented in a mystery by that
ark which Moses made as a symbol; in it were the tables of the Law
written by God, but in you, Mary, was the bread of life in truth.<br>



<br>



Blessed are the dead who have slept and rested in peace; the flesh of
the Son is buried with them as a pledge; he will cast down the walls of
Sheol for them with violence and they will hear his voice and will go
forth to meet him with speed.<br>



<br>



Son, who were born of the daughter of David in the flesh, pour fourth your mercy on your flock in abundance.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">


Conclusion</span><br>



<br>



It is good to give thanks to the Lord and to sing praise to your name
Most High; to proclaim in the morning your loving kindness and your
faithfulness in the night. Lord, in the morning you shall hear my voice
and in the morning I have prepared myself to appear before you. Lord, I
have compassion on your people, Lord, pardon and forgive the sins of us
all. Holy one, let your right hand rest upon us and pardon our
infirmity, because your name is forever.<br>
