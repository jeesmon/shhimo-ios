<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lord's Prayer</span><br>
<br>
Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread: and forgive us our debts and sins, as we also have
forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
the evil one. For Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory,
forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hail Mary</span><br>
<br>
Hail, Mary, full of Grace, our Lord is with thee; blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, our Lord Jesus
Christ. Oh Virgin Saint Mary, Oh Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at all times, and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br>
<br>
I<span style="font-weight: bold;">ntroductory Prayer of Ramsho</span><br>
<br>
Grant us, Lord God, that while our bodies rest from the labors of the
day and our souls are released from worldly thoughts, we may stand in
your presence with tranquility at this time of evening and that we may
offer you ceaseless praise and uninterrupted thanksgiving; that we may
acknowledge your loving kindness by which you direct and rule our
lives, and protect and save our souls; to you we offer praise and
thanksgiving, now and always and forever. Amen<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Psalms of Ramsho (Ps. 141, 142, 119:105-112, 117)</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Kurielaison</span> Lord, I have called upon you, answer me: hear and receive my words.<br>
<br>
Let my prayer be like incense in your sight, the offering of my hands
like the evening offering.&nbsp; Set a guard, Lord, before my mouth, a
guard before my lips that my heart may not turn to evil words and I may
not do deeds of wickedness.<br>
<br>
Let me not take salt with impious men; let the just man teach me and
reprove me: let not the oil of the impious anoint my head; because my
prayer was against their evil-doing: their judges have been restrained
by the side of the rock; and they have heard how gentle are my words. <br>
<br>
As when a plough cleaves the earth their bones have been scattered at
the mouth of Sheol.&nbsp; I have lifted my eyes to you, Lord, and in
you have I put my trust, do not cast away my soul.<br>
<br>
Keep me from the hand of the proud, who have laid snares for me; let the wicked fall into their nets, while I pass on.<br>
With my voice I cried to the Lord; with my voice I besought the Lord
and poured my prayer before him; I showed him my affliction, when my
spirit was troubled, but you know my path.<br>
In the way of my walking they have laid a snare for me; I look to the
right and see none that knows me: the way of escape has gone from me
and there is none who cares for my soul, I cried to you, Lord, and
said: you are my hope and my portion in the land of the living.<br>
<br>
Hear my petition because I am brought very low; deliver me from my
persecutors because they are too strong for me.&nbsp; Lead me forth
from prison that I may give thanks to your name: your just ones shall
have hope when you shall reward me.<br>
<br>
Your word is a lamp to my feet and light to my path; I have sworn and
am resolved to keep the judgments of your justice.&nbsp; I am greatly
brought low, Lord, give me life according to your word; be pleased with
the words of my mouth, Lord, and teach me your judgments.<br>
<br>
My soul is ever in my hands, and I have no forgotten your law; sinners
have laid snares for me and I have not strayed from your
commands.&nbsp; I shall inherit your testimony forever because it is
dear to my heart; I have turned my heart to do your commands forever in
truth.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Praise the Lord, all you nations; praise him, all you peoples; for his grace is strong over us, truly the Lord is forever.<br>
<br>
And to you belongs the praise, O God. Barekmor.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

<br>
</span>Blessed are you dead on the day, when the resurrection comes,
you who ate the living body and drank the propitiatory blood; it shall
raise you up at the right hand side. Stomen Kalos, Kurielaison<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Qolo<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-style: italic;">Bless the Lord, my soul.</span><br>
Give rest, Christ our king, with all your saints to the souls of your
servants in peace, where death does not reign nor suffering nor sorrow
but life eternal.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
I called upon you, Lord, all the day, and I stretched out my hands
towards you, because you have done wonders for the departed; the might
shall praise you and tell of you grace, that you are he who raises the
dead. <br>
<br>
He came forth from you in humility, the most High, who became little,
that he might raise up the fallen earthly Adam, and he has honored and
magnified your memory here&nbsp; and above in heaven; may your prayer
be a stronghold to us.<br>
<br>
Moses the prophet saw on the mountain a fire, which rested on a bush
and the bush was not burned by it; it was a figure of the virgin Mary,
in whom the Son of God dwelt, and she was not burned by his flame.<br>
<br>
Peace be with the prophets, peace be with the apostles, peace be with
the martyrs, who loved the Lord of peace, and peace be with the holy
Church, in whom dwell the sons of peace.<br>
<br>
Like the wall of a city Moses placed the bones of Joseph in the camp of
the Israelites, and your bones, O martyrs, have been made a stronghold
for our souls; may we be protected beneath your wings.<br>
<br>
Joseph made his brothers swear in the name of God, when he was dying;
do not leave me in a foreign land; bring up my bones from Egypt, that I
may go in your company, and the Lord will be your helper.<br>
<br>
To the sinful woman, who anointed your feet, O sea full of mercy, you
forgave her sins and her offences; and I, who have wretchedly sinned
against you, like the publican I cry to you, have compassion on me and
have mercy on me. <br>
<br>
Let us open the graves and consider the heroes and noble men, who have
fallen there into corruption.&nbsp; Behold , their stature&nbsp; is
brought low and they are reduced to dust in Sheol; be mindful, Lord, of
your image.<br>
<br>
The death which the just taste is not that death which is forever;
their bodies rest, as it were, in sleep, until the day of resurrection;
their bodies remain in the earth and shall rise and give praise.<br>

</span><span style="font-style: italic;">May our God have mercy upon us.</span><br>
In the evening when the just complete their labors and receive their
wages, complete the work of your grace in us and drive away the evil
one from us.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
In the service of evening and in the time of prayer have compassion on
us and, when you set up your seat of judgment, raise us up at your
right hand.<br>
<br>
Make petition on our behalf, O pride of those who believe, to the only
Son, who came forth from you, that he may have mercy on us all.<br>
<br>
Virgin, who were the source from whom life was transmitted, make
supplication to your only Son, that he may have mercy on us all.<br>
<br>
May the prophets, who spoke of you by the Spirit, and the apostles, who
announced your revelation, and the martyrs who died for love of you,
intercede with you; have mercy upon us.<br>
<br>
Intercede with us, you saints, to him whose will you did, that he may banish and remove from us the scourge and rod of wrath.<br>
<br>
Your memory, O Mar (X), is here on earth and above in heaven; may those, who honor your memory, be helped by your prayers.<br>
<br>
On your door, O compassionate one, knocks the voice of our petition; do
not withhold from your worshippers the answer to their needs.<br>
<br>
O God, on you we call tor help in our weakness; hear, O Good one, the voice of our prayer and answer our requests in your mercy.<br>
<br>
May the departed, Lord, who were clothed in you in the waters of
baptism, be clothed by your right hand in the garment of glory in your
kingdom.<br>
<br>
Of the departed, Lord, whose memory we celebrate today, may the names be written in the book of life in your kingdom.<br>

</span>As a father pities his children, halleluia and halleluia, the Lord has pity on those who tear him.<br>
<br>
The days of man are like grass, halleluia and halleluia, like the flower of the field so he blooms.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

<br>
</span>The thunder of the resurrection will thunder over the depths of
Sheol, and death will hear it and be dismayed, and the forms which were
wasted away will be renewed. Full of mercy, renew your servants who
have rested in your hope.<br>

</span>Abraham presented incense to you and Noah offered you sacrifice;
refresh by your grace your servants for whom we present incense.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br>
Have pity, Lord, on our departed who are laid in the earth like seed;
raise them up, as you are wont, and comfort those who mourn. <br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">B’outho of Mar Jacob</span><br>
<br>
Give rest to your servants among the must, Son of God, in that kingdom which has no end among the saints.<br>
<br>
The generations succeed one another on the way of the world and go one
after the other and hasten to depart; behold, they follow one another
on the crossing of the great bridge and one presses upon another to
reach to the end. <br>
<br>
In the days of their life men command like God but at the time of their
end they all die like beasts; yesterday they were proud kings, exalted
and powerful, today they are dead, fallen, cast down and wretched.<br>
<br>
Christ who prayed that the cup of death might pass from you, make to pass from us the cup of the second death.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Concluding Prayer of Ramsho</span><br>
<br>
O Jesus Christ our Lord, close not the door of Thy mercy upon our
faces.&nbsp; We confess that we are sinners; have mercy upon us.&nbsp;
O Lord, Thy love for us, didst make Thee to come down to us from Thy
place.&nbsp; That by Thy death, our death might be abolished; Have
mercy upon us. Amen.<br>
