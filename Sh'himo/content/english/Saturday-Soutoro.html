<span style="font-weight: bold;">Introductory Prayer of Soutoro</span><br>
<br>
Protect us, Lord, beneath the wings of your loving kindness and turn
our hard hearts to the knowledge of your truth; grant us to know and to
consider that the evening which has called us to rest and refreshment
from labor is a figure of the end of this present life; that we may be
diligent in good actions which are pleasing to your will, and we will
offer your praise and thanksgiving, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; now
and always and forever and ever. Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Qolo<br>
<br>
</span>Teach me, Lord, the way of your commandments, and I will keep
them, and I will live in your grace; place guards over the doors of my
limbs that lie open, lest the treasure of your gifts be stolen. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br>
Glory to him, who bears with us and suffers us in his compassion and is
patient of heart, that we may depart from our sins; and we, poor
wretches, do not take it to heart, that the end of the world stands at
the door.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">B’outho of Mar Jacob</span><br>
<br>
We call upon you, Lord our Lord, come to our help, hear our petition and have mercy on our souls.<br>
<br>
Woe to the earth, when the last day shall come upon it, when it shall
be corrupted by sin and impiety and defilement; the earth will cry out
like a mother, who bows down and brings forth, and- when wars and
calamities increase, she will totter to her fall.<br>
The world shall cease from service and sacrifice, and avarice and the
love of money shall prevail on the earth; in the last days nation shall
rise against nation and towns shall be devastated and trembling shall
fall upon cities.<br>
<br>
Have a care, Lord, for the churches and the monasteries, for, behold,
the day is at hand, when your praise shall cease within them.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Psalms of Soutoro (Ps. 91, 121)</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Kurielaison, Kurielaison, Kurielaison</span>, He sits under the protection of the Most High, and glories in the shelter of God.<br>
<br>
I said to the Lord, my trust is in your, God is my refuge in whom I trust.<br>
<br>
He shall deliver you from the snare which makes you stumble, and from talk of vain things.<br>
<br>
He will keep you safe under his feathers and you shall be protected beneath his wings, his truth shall enclose you as an armor.<br>
<br>
You shall not be afraid of the terror of the night, or of the arrow which flies by day.<br>
<br>
Of the word which walks in the darkness, or of the spirit that wastes at midday.<br>
<br>
Thousands shall fall at your side and ten thousand at your right hand<br>
<br>
But it shall not come near to you, but with your eyes alone you shall see.<br>
<br>
You shall see the reward of the wicked, because you, Lord are my trust.<br>
<br>
You have made your dwelling I the heights, evil shall not come near you.<br>
<br>
Affliction shall not come near your tent, because he has commanded his angels concerning you.<br>
<br>
That they should keep you in all your ways, and receive you in their arms;<br>
<br>
That you may not stumble with your foot, you shall tread upon the asp and the basilisk<br>
<br>
You shall tread upon the lion and the dragon, because he has cried to me, I will deliver him and strengthen him.<br>
<br>
Because he has known my name he shall call upon me and I will answer him, I will be with him in distress. <br>
<br>
I will strengthen him and honor him; I will satisfy him with length of days.<br>
<br>
I will show him my salvation; I have lifted up my eyes to the hills.<br>
<br>
From whence will come my help, my help is from the Lord,<br>
<br>
Who made heaven and earth, he will not suffer your foot to slip.<br>
<br>
Your guardian shall not sleep, indeed he neither slumbers no sleeps.<br>
<br>
The guardian of Israel, the Lord is your guardian.<br>
<br>
The Lord shall shelter you with his right hand, by day the sun shall not harm you,<br>
<br>
Nor the moon by night, the Lord shall guard you from all evil.<br>
<br>
The Lord shall guard your soul, he shall guard your going out and coming in.<br>
<br>
From henceforth and forever more.<br>
<br>
And to you belongs the praise, O God, Barekmor.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Prayer of St. Severus<br>
</span>&nbsp;<br>
He dwells under the protection of the Most High, beneath the shadow of the wings of your loving kindness.<br>
<br>
Protect us, Lord, and have mercy upon us; you who hear all, hear the prayer of servants in your loving kindness. <br>
<br>
An evening full of peace and a night of holiness, grant us, Christ our Savior, for you are the king of glory.<br>
<br>
To you our eyes are turned, pardon our offences and our sins; in this world and in the world to come, have mercy on us.<br>
<br>
Lord let your mercy protect us and your grace rest upon our faces, let your cross guard us from the evil on and his powers.<br>
<br>
May your right hand rest upon us all the days of our life, and your
peace reign among us and give hope and salvation to the souls of those
who pray to you.<br>
