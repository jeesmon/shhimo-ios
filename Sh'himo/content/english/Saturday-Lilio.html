death in the sleep of death and corruption, that we may adore your
compassion, you who live and do not die; grant us in the glorious
company of the angels who praise you in heaven, to praise you and bless
you in holiness, because you are praised and blessed in heaven and on
earth, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and always and forever. Amen. <br>

<br>
Mary said: My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God,
my Savior; Because He has looked upon the lowliness, of His handmaid; <br>
<br>
Because He who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is His
name. And His mercy is from generation to generation on those who fear
Him.<br>
<br>
He has won victory with His arm, He has scattered the proud in the
conceit of their heart. He has put down the mighty from their thrones,
and has exalted the lowly.<br>
<br>
He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich He has sent
empty away. He has given help to Israel His servant, mindful of His
mercy. Even as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and His seed forever.<br>

King.<br>
<br>
Let them praise His name with the timbrel and the drum, let them sing
to Him with the harp: for the Lord takes pleasure in His people, and
gives salvation to the poor.<br>
<br>
Let the just exult in glory, let them praise Him on their beds: let the
high praises of God be in their throats, and two-edged swords in their
hands.<br>
<br>
To execute vengeance on the nations, and to rebuke the peoples; to bind
their kings with chains, their nobles with fetters of iron, to execute
on them the judgment which is written: that is the glory of the just.<br>

Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread: and forgive us our debts and sins, as we also have
forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
the evil one. For Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory,
forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.<br>
