<br>
Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread: and forgive us our debts and sins, as we also have
forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
the evil one. For Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory,
forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.<br>

now and at all times, and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Introductory Prayer of Lilio</span><br>
<br>
Awaken us, Lord, from our sleep in the sloth of sin that we may praise
your watchfulness, you who watch and do not sleep; give life to our
death in the sleep of death and corruption, that we may adore your
compassion, you who live and do not die; grant us in the glorious
company of the angels who praise you in heaven, to praise you and bless
you in holiness, because you are praised and blessed in heaven and on
earth, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and always and forever. Amen. <br>

<br>
Bless the Lord, all you servants of the Lord.<br>
<br>
You who stand by night in the house of the Lord.<br>
<br>
May the Lord bless you from Zion, He who made heaven and earth.<br>
<br>
Let my praise enter before You, Lord, and give me life by Your word; let my cry enter before You, <br>
<br>
My tongue shall pour forth Your word, because all Your commands are just.<br>
<br>
My lips shall speak Your praise when You have taught me Your commands;
let Your hand help me because I have taken pleasure in Your commands.<br>
<br>
My soul has longed for Your salvation and I have meditated on Your law;
let my soul live and I will praise You and Your judgments shall help me.<br>
I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek for Your servant, because I have not forgotten all Your commands<br>
<br>
Praise the Lord, all you nations, praise Him, all you peoples; because His grace is strong over us, the <br>
Lord is truly forever. <br>
<br>
And to you belongs the praise, O God, Barekmor.<br>

<br>
Awaken and raise me up from the sleep of forgetfulness to the praise of your majesty, O Lord God.<br>
<br>
Your mercy has awakened me to praise you in the middle of the night; grant me forgiveness of offences, O Lord God. <br>
<br>
I have remembered that the Watchers never sleep and like them I have risen; I will praise you, O lover of men.<br>
<br>
I have remembered that I have sinned and in sorrow my tears have
flowed; let your mercy be moved towards me, and pardon me all that I
have sinned against you. <br>
<br>
I have remembered by night your worshipful and holy name, and I have
risen to give thanks to you and to praise you, O lover of men.<br>
<br>
I have sinned, Lord, and you have not taken vengeance upon me; I repent
and you have received me; let your mercy be moved towards me, and
pardon me all that I have sinned against you. <br>
<br>
You who hear and do not disregard, who answer and save and deliver, let
your mercy be moved towards me, and pardon me all that I have sinned
against you.<br>
<br>
My offences are many and at the seat of judgment behold they confront
me; let your mercy be moved towards me and pardon me all that I have
sinned against you.<br>
<br>
As you pardoned the offences of the sinful woman in the house of Simon, pardon me my offences, Lord God.<br>
<br>
In the Jerusalem which is above and in the Church which is on earth,
make memory, Lord, of your servants who have rested in your hope. <br>

A young maiden of the house of David, whose name was Mary, was the
chariot which carried the Savior of the world. It seems to me that she
was much greater than the chariot which Ezekiel saw; this had faces and
wheels which spoke, but Mary had a mouth to sing praise to you, O Lord,
halleluia, may her prayer assist us. <br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

Let everyone who has mouth and tongue and word call Mary blessed, who
is worthy of blessings; blessed is she who was the blessed field in
which the ear of corn grew, the source of joy; blessed is she who was
the chariot and her knees were the wheels, and in her womb of flesh she
bore the Savior of the world, halleluia, may her prayer assist us.<br>

drive away the darkness from the face of the earth.<br>

Daughter, of the poor, who were the mother of the Son of God, and gave
wealth to the world in need that it might live from it; ship, who
carried the blessings and the treasures of the house of the Father, and
came and poured out your wealth on our barren earth.<br>

Mary said: My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God,

<br>
Because He who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is His
name. And His mercy is from generation to generation on those who fear
Him.<br>
<br>
He has won victory with His arm, He has scattered the proud in the
conceit of their heart. He has put down the mighty from their thrones,
and has exalted the lowly.<br>
<br>
He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich He has sent
empty away. He has given help to Israel His servant, mindful of His
mercy. Even as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and His seed forever.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lord's Prayer</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread: and forgive us our debts and sins, as we also have
forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
the evil one. For Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory,
forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hail Mary</span><br>
<br>
Hail, Mary, full of Grace, our Lord is with thee; blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, our Lord Jesus
Christ. Oh Virgin Saint Mary, Oh Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at all times, and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br>
