<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lord's Prayer</span><br>
<br>
Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread: and forgive us our debts and sins, as we also have
forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
the evil one. For Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory,
forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hail Mary</span><br>
<br>
Hail, Mary, full of Grace, our Lord is with thee; blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, our Lord Jesus
Christ. Oh Virgin Saint Mary, Oh Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at all times, and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Introductory Prayer of Sapro</span><br>
<br>
Creator of the morning, who drive out the darkness and bring light and
joy to the creation; create in us habits of virtue and drive from us
all the darkness of sin; give us light and joy by the glorious rays of
your grace, Lord our God, forever. Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Psalms 51</span><br>
<br>
Have mercy on me, God, in your loving kindness; in the abundance of your mercy blot out my sin.<br>
<br>
Wash me thoroughly from my guilt and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my fault and my sins are before me always.<br>
<br>
Against you only have I sinned and done evil in your sight, that you
may be justified in your words and vindicated in your judgment. For I
was born in guilt and in sin did my mother conceive me.<br>
<br>
But you take pleasure in truth and you have made known to me the
secrets of your wisdom. Sprinkle me with your hyssop and I shall be
clean; wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.<br>
<br>
Give me the comfort of your joy and gladness, and the bones which have
been humbled shall rejoice. Turn away your face from my sins and blot
out all my faults.<br>
<br>
Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew your steadfast spirit
within me. Do not cast me from your presence and take not your Holy
Spirit from me. <br>
But restore to me your joy and your salvation and let your glorious
spirit sustain me; that I may teach the wicked your way and sinners may
return to you.<br>
<br>
Deliver me from blood, O God, God of my salvation, and my tongue
shall praise your justice.&nbsp; Lord , open my lips and my mouth shall
sing your praise.<br>
<br>
For you do not take 'pleasure in sacrifices; by burnt offerings you are
not appeased. The sacrifice of God is a humble spirit, a heart that is
contrite will not despise.<br>
<br>
Do good in your good pleasure to Zion and build up the walls of
Jerusalem. Then shall you be satisfied with sacrifices of truth and
with whole burnt-offerings; then shall they offer bullocks upon your
altar. And to you belongs the praise, O God.<br>
<br>
And to you belongs the praise, O God, Barekmor.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Psalm 63</span><br>
<br>
My God, you are my God, I will seek you.<br>
<br>
My soul thirsts for you and my flesh seeks for you like the thirsty earth which is parched and begging for water.<br>
<br>
So have I looked for you in truth, that I may see your power and your glory.<br>
<br>
Because your loving kindness is better than life and my lips shall praise you.<br>
<br>
So I will bless you while I live and will lift up my hands in your name.<br>
<br>
My soul shall be enriched as with marrow and fat and my mouth shall praise you with lips of praise.<br>
<br>
I have remembered you upon my bed and in the night time I have meditated on you.<br>
<br>
For you have been my helper and in the shadow of your wings is my protection.<br>
<br>
My soul follows after you and your right hand upholds me.<br>
<br>
Those who seek to destroy my soul shall enter into the lower parts of the earth.<br>
<br>
They shall be delivered over to the sword and shall be food for foxes; but the king shall rejoice in God.<br>
<br>
Everyone who swears by him shall glory, but the mouth of those who speak lies shall be stopped.<br>
<br>
And to you belongs the praise, O God, Barekmor.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>

<br>
I have come before you and I have worshipped before your throne; Lord of heaven, pardon me all that I have sinned against you.<br>
<br>
I rose in the morning that I might confess my faults to you, O lover of men; pardon me all that I have sinned against you.<br>
<br>
I beg of you and I long for your mercy, good and gentle one; pardon me all that I have sinned against you.<br>
<br>
You drew Simon from the raging of the sea, draw your Church, Lord, from schisms and disputes.<br>
<br>
Light and Son of Light, abiding in light and dwelling in light, make me
worthy of that light which the darkness does not overtake.<br>
<br>
The light gladdens the creation at the hour of morning and all that are in it stand and sing praise and thanksgiving.<br>
<br>
The world saw your light and was gladdened when it was in gloom, and behold it sings praise with its children for ever.<br>
Pure and holy one, whom the living fire serves, receives our service and answer in your mercy our requests. <br>
<br>
I have sinned, Lord, and you have not taken vengeance on me; I repent
and you have received me; may your mercy be moved towards me, and
pardon me all that I have sinned against you.<br>
<br>
You who hear and do not disregard, who answer and redeem and save, may
your mercy be moved towards me, and pardon me all that I have sinned
against you.<br>
<br>
I have received, Lord, your body, and by your blood my offences have
been pardoned; do not leave me in Sheol, you who are the resurrection
of the children of Adam.<br>
<br>
In the Jerusalem which is above and in the Church on earth make memory, Lord, of your servants who have slept in your hope.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br>
Glory to you, our Lord, whose praise is in heaven and on earth; those in heaven and those on earth praise your name. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Psalm 113</span><br>
<br>
Praise, you servants of the Lord, praise the name of the Lord.<br>
<br>
May the Lord's name be blessed forever and forever.<br>
<br>
From the rising of the sun to its setting great is the name of the Lord.<br>
<br>
The Lord is high above all peoples and his glory is above the heavens.<br>
<br>
Who is like the Lord, our God, who sits on high and looks upon the depths in heaven and on earth?<br>
<br>
He raises up the poor from the dunghill, and makes him sit with the princes of the people.<br>
<br>
He makes the barren woman keep house and be a joyful mother of children. <br>
<br>
And to you belongs the praise, O God, Barekmor.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Eqbo</span><br>
<br>
Awaken me, Lord to the voice of praise by the mouth of the angels, that
I may sing your praise in the morning; I have opened my mouth to sing
praise, that I may give thanks; my Lord and my God, have mercy upon me.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Qolo</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Answer me, Lord, and hear my prayer, halleluia</span><br>
Like the incense which Aaron offered may our incense be received; and
like the prayer of the Ninivites receive our service; and as you
answered Jonah in the sea, answer your servants who call upon you<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
Glory to the mercy of your grace, Jesus God, because your bounty flows
over the whole world, and when the Ninivites called upon you, you
delivered them from wrath.<br>
<br>
Most High, who are exalted in glory on a high throne, and were pleased
to be carried in the womb of the blessed virgin, make your peace and
tranquility dwell in the four quarters of the creation.<br>
<br>
As the fire rested on the bush and the bush was not burnt, so God
descended and rested on the virgin; he was pleased to take flesh from
her and he did not break the seal of her virginity.<br>
<br>
By the prayers, Lord of all, of the prophets who loved you, and by the
intercession of the apostles who proclaimed your gospel, make your
peace and tranquility dwell in the four quarters of the creation.<br>
<br>
The martyrs hated the goods of this passing world and renounced fathers
and brothers and nation and race and desired death for the sake of
Jesus, and behold their memory is glorious.<br>
<br>
In your light we shall see light, Jesus full of light; you are the true
light which enlightens the whole creation; enlighten us with your joyous
light, splendor of the Father in heaven.<br>
<br>
God who accepted the lamb of Abel the innocent and the offering of Noah
the just and the sacrifice of Abraham, accept our fasting and our
prayer and answer in your mercy our petitions. <br>
<br>
Make a good memory, Lord, of the faithful departed, who ate your holy
body and drank your living blood; let them stand at your right hand on
the day when your majesty appears.<br>
<br>
May the faithful departed be fed at your table and be satisfied with
your good things and drink of your fountain and be drunk with the
riches of your house and may they praise your worshipful name.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Rich and poor together.</span><br>
In the morning let us hasten to prayer like Abraham to the sacrifice;
that on the great morning which is to come we may see Christ and he may
say to us: Come in peace, good and trusty servants, come, enter and
inherit the kingdom and life which does not pass away.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
Glory be to the Trinity which awaits us as a court of judgment; glory
be to the Trinity which forgives our offences; glory be to you, O God,
because the darkness will not overtake anyone who believes in you,
because your light dwells in him.<br>
<br>
From the Father the Lord came forth to us and from the daughter of
David the Savior, and from Bethlehem the bread of life for the people
who believed in him; worshipful is the Father who sent his Son, blessed
is Mary who bore him, blessed is the church who received him and behold
she sings praise.<br>
<br>
Let all generations among all peoples call Mary blessed, who was worthy
to become mother to the Son of God; he came forth from her while the
seals of her virginity were kept unbroken; behold the day of her
remembrance is honored in heaven and on earth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Our Lord Jesus sent twelve physicians to the four corners of the
creation, and thus he said to them: drive out devils from men and heal
those who are sick; freely you received the gift, freely give of it.<br>
<br>
The blessed martyrs were ascending to that Jerusalem which is in heaven
and the Holy Spirit met them and greeted them: come in peace, my
brothers and my sons, children of the heavenly marriage-chamber, come,
enter, inherit the kingdom and life which does not pass away.<br>
<br>
Blessed are you, blessed father, noble Mar (X), whom the evil world did
not stain with all its pleasures; like a bird you escaped from its
snares and fled to the desert and were delivered, and the day of your
remembrance is honored in heaven and on earth.<br>
<br>
From the pit of misery and the mire of corruption and the outer
darkness deliver us, Lord; when the judgment takes place and the
martyrs receive their crowns, may we enter with them the
marriage-chamber and sing praise to you.<br>
<br>
Not for the sake of the just did I come, said our Lord, but for
sinners, that they may repent. Behold the door of the Lord is open;
sinners, repent and live, for I desire not your death, said God.<br>
<br>
Let us remember our fathers, who taught us when they were living to be
children of God in this passing world; may the Son of God give them
rest in the kingdom of heaven with the just and the righteous, in the
world which does not pass.<br>
<br>
Listen to the Son when he says, that in the hour when the dead shall
hear the living voice of God, they shall stand and be raised up, those
who have done good for the resurrection of new life, and those who have
done evil for the resurrection of judgments.<br>

<br>
Hear my words, O Lord, and consider my meditation, halleluia, hear the voice of my cry, my king and my God.<br>
<br>
In the morning I prepared myself to appear before you, halleluia, because you are a God who take no pleasure in wickedness.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>

Sons of the Father in heaven, you who do the will of the Lord, praise

In the morning the trumpets sounded and the walls of Jericho fell;
while the people of Israel cried the Lord is God. In the morning lift
up your voices, my brothers, and sing praise to God, that he may have
mercy on the whole world.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
Glory to the heavenly physician who descended from the heights to the
depths, that he might heal the diseases and the sickness of the race of
Adam; the lepers met him and were cleansed, the blind and they saw the
light, and the sinful woman who approached him received forgiveness. <br>

<br>
Open to us, Lord, your great door full of mercy, hear our prayer and have mercy on our souls.<br>
<br>
Shine upon me, Lord, and I shall be light like the day; I will sing
your praise in light while I marvel; may the morning awaken me to the
praise of your godhead and I will pursue the study of your word all the
day.<br>
<br>
Behold the morning brings a pure incense to offer to you; may we also
offer all the thanksgiving which is due to you. At your command the
sleep of night has passed from us, make to pass with it the sin which
afflicts and wounds us.<br>
<br>
Light which gives life to all creatures at the time of morning, give
light to our minds that they may thank you, Lord for your grace.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Conclusion</span><br>
<br>
It is good to give thanks to the Lord and to sing praise to your name
Most High; to proclaim in the morning your loving kindness and your
faithfulness in the night. Lord, in the morning you shall hear my voice
and in the morning I have prepared myself to appear before you. Lord, I
have compassion on your people, Lord, pardon and forgive the sins of us
all. Holy one, let your right hand rest upon us and pardon our
infirmity, because your name is forever.<br>
