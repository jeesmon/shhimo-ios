<br>


Awaken us, Lord, from our sleep in the sloth of sin that we may praise
your watchfulness, you who watch and do not sleep; give life to our
death in the sleep of death and corruption, that we may adore your
compassion, you who live and do not die; grant us in the glorious
company of the angels who praise you in heaven, to praise you and bless
you in holiness, because you are praised and blessed in heaven and on
earth, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and always and forever. Amen. <br>

Bless the Lord, all you servants of the Lord.<br>

You who stand by night in the house of the Lord.<br>


<br>


May the Lord bless you from Zion, He who made heaven and earth.<br>


<br>


Let my praise enter before You, Lord, and give me life by Your word; let my cry enter before You, <br>


<br>


My tongue shall pour forth Your word, because all Your commands are just.<br>


<br>


My lips shall speak Your praise when You have taught me Your commands;
let Your hand help me because I have taken pleasure in Your commands.<br>


<br>


My soul has longed for Your salvation and I have meditated on Your law;
let my soul live and I will praise You and Your judgments shall help me.<br>


<br>


I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek for Your servant, because I have not forgotten all Your commands<br>


<br>


Praise the Lord, all you nations, praise Him, all you peoples; because His grace is strong over us, the <br>


Lord is truly forever. <br>


<br>

The Father wrote a letter by a Watcher and sent it to Nazareth, to the
virgin Mary, whom he chose and took: pleasure in her, that she should
become the mother of his only Son, when he should descend to redeem the
world.<br>

<br>


The virgin has brought forth a wonder; come, let us go and contemplate
the ancient of the ages wrapped in swaddling clothes; the virgin has
brought forth an elder, the ancient of days; the mighty one who hung
the mountains is carried by a young maiden; he who gives bread to the
hungry sucks milk like an infant; the Son who had no beginning willed
to have a beginning and came to birth and he is without end.<br>


<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">

Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

The just of old gave fair and lovely names to Mary, the daughter of
David, the holy virgin: Ezekiel, the exile, called her the closed door;
Solomon, the garden enclosed and the sealed fountain; David named her a
city and Christ is the blade which shot up within it without seed; he
has become the food of the nations and he has exalted her memory in
heaven and on earth.<br>

<br>


May your prayer be with us, blessed one, may your prayer be with us; may the Lord hear your&nbsp; prayer and have pity on us. <br>


A watcher descended when Mary was standing at prayer, and gave her the
greeting of peace which had been sent to her by God: peace be with you,
said the fiery one to her: you shall conceive and bear a son in your
virginity.<br>


<br>


The Watcher said: do not be troubled, full of beauty, the Lord is
pleased that you should become the mother of his only Son; behold from
now you shall receive a conception full of wonder, and shall bring
forth a child whose kingdom shall have no end.<br>


<br>


By the prayer of her who carried you for nine months, Son of God, remove from us the scourge of wrath.<br>

You righteous, who loved the truth, and you just, who died for the love
of the Son of God, your memory is a blessing; you are harbors of relief

Fair and lovely was the word which our Lord spoke in his Gospel, when
he declared blessed the zealous who have loved him: blessed are the

which they bore, and the afflictions which they endured they shall
inherit the kingdom and life which does not pass away.<br>

Our fathers and our brothers have fallen asleep and have departed from
this temporal life, until the day of resurrection comes for those who
sleep; give rest, Lord, to their souls in abodes of light, and may
their bones in the grave be quickened on the day of their memory; and
when your command raises up the children of the earthly Adam, may they
be clothed with glory and honor, and enter with you the bridal-chamber,
and offer praise to you who are their resurrection.<br>

that they may be remembered here in the Church; they will be written
above in heaven, and when he comes in glory they will take pleasure
with him.<br>

Magnificat – St. Luke 1:46-55</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">


<br>


Mary said: My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God,
my Savior; Because He has looked upon the lowliness, of His handmaid; <br>


<br>


Because He who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is His
name. And His mercy is from generation to generation on those who fear
Him.<br>


<br>


He has won victory with His arm, He has scattered the proud in the
conceit of their heart. He has put down the mighty from their thrones,
and has exalted the lowly.<br>


<br>


He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich He has sent
empty away. He has given help to Israel His servant, mindful of His
mercy. Even as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and His seed forever.<br>

Blessed is He who does not keep His mercy from the sinner who calls upon Him.<br>

Praise the Lord from the heavens, praise Him in the heights.<br>

Praise Him, all His angels; praise Him, all his hosts.<br>


<br>


Praise Him, sun and moon; praise Him, all stars of light; praise Him,
heaven of heavens, and the waters above the heavens: let them praise
the name of the Lord.<br>


<br>


For He spoke and they were made, He commanded and they were created; He
established them forever and ever, He gave them a law which shall not
pass away.<br>


<br>


Praise the Lord from the earth, sea-monsters and all depths; fire and hail, snow and mist, stormy winds that fulfill His word.<br>


<br>


Mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars; wild beasts and all cattle, creeping things and birds that fly.<br>


<br>


Kings of the earth and all peoples, princes and all judges of the
earth: young men too and maidens, old men and boys: let them praise the
name of the Lord.<br>

Psalm 149</span><br>

Praise the Lord with a new praise in the assembly of the just; let
Israel be glad in her Maker, let the children of Zion rejoice in their
King.<br>


<br>


Let them praise His name with the timbrel and the drum, let them sing
to Him with the harp: for the Lord takes pleasure in His people, and
gives salvation to the poor.<br>


<br>


Let the just exult in glory, let them praise Him on their beds: let the
high praises of God be in their throats, and two-edged swords in their
hands.<br>


<br>


To execute vengeance on the nations, and to rebuke the peoples; to bind
their kings with chains, their nobles with fetters of iron, to execute
on them the judgment which is written: that is the glory of the just.<br>


<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">

Psalm 150</span><br>

Praise the Lord in His holy place, praise Him in the firmament of His strength.<br>

Praise Him for His mighty deeds, praise Him for His abounding
greatness, praise Him with the sound of the trumpet, praise Him with
lyre and harp.<br>


<br>


Praise Him with the timbrel and the drum, praise Him with the soft
strings, praise Him with the loud cymbals; praise Him with the sound of
the voice; let everything that has breath praise the Lord.<br>

Praise the Lord, all you nations; praise Him, all you peoples.<br>

<br>


Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread: and forgive us our debts and sins, as we also have
forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
the evil one. For Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory,
forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.<br>

Hail Mary</span><br>


<br>


Hail, Mary, full of Grace, our Lord is with thee; blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, our Lord Jesus
Christ. Oh Virgin Saint Mary, Oh Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at all times, and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br>
