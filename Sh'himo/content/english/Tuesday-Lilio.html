Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come;

Introductory Prayer of Lilio</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">


<br>


Awaken us, Lord, from our sleep in the sloth of sin that we may praise
your watchfulness, you who watch and do not sleep; give life to our
death in the sleep of death and corruption, that we may adore your
compassion, you who live and do not die; grant us in the glorious
company of the angels who praise you in heaven, to praise you and bless
you in holiness, because you are praised and blessed in heaven and on
earth, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and always and forever. Amen. <br>

Psalms of Lilio (Ps. 134, 119:169-176)</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">


<br>


Bless the Lord, all you servants of the Lord.<br>


<br>


You who stand by night in the house of the Lord.<br>


<br>


May the Lord bless you from Zion, He who made heaven and earth.<br>


<br>


Let my praise enter before You, Lord, and give me life by Your word; let my cry enter before You, <br>


<br>


My tongue shall pour forth Your word, because all Your commands are just.<br>


<br>


My lips shall speak Your praise when You have taught me Your commands;
let Your hand help me because I have taken pleasure in Your commands.<br>


<br>


My soul has longed for Your salvation and I have meditated on Your law;
let my soul live and I will praise You and Your judgments shall help me.<br>


I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek for Your servant, because I have not forgotten all Your commands<br>


Praise the Lord, all you nations, praise Him, all you peoples; because His grace is strong over us, the <br>


Lord is truly forever. <br>

<br>


Awake, sinner, while you have time for repentance; with tears and sighs cleanse and purify your stains. <br>


<br>


O you who have sinned, do not neglect repentance, because your Lord loves those who repent and he will forgive your fault. <br>


<br>


If you wish that your offences should be forgiven swiftly, call with passion upon God and he will forgive you your fault. <br>


<br>


Let soul and body appease you, Lord, by repentance, while they cry with passion and say; Lord of all, glory to you. <br>


<br>


Mighty Lord, who redeemed the children of men from the slavery of sin, Lord of all, glory to you. <br>


<br>


May the right hand of the Lord, which divided the sea before the host, open the door of mercy to our prayers and petitions. <br>


<br>


On the day when the doors of your bridal chamber are opened, Christ the
king, give me garments worthy of the marriage-feast in your mercy, Lord
of all. <br>


<br>


On the day when the throne of your majesty is set up, judge of all,
that you may judge the peoples and the nations, have compassion on me,
Lord of all. <br>


<br>


Trembling makes me afraid at the hidden faults which I have committed;
God, who are lover of men, have compassion on me in your mercy, Lord of
all. <br>


<br>


Let our departed dwell in tabernacles of light with your saints, where there reigns neither death nor pain nor grief. <br>

intercession and offer our prayers before God; she says to her Lord and

Magnificat – St. Luke 1:46-55</span><br>


<br>


Mary said: My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God,
my Savior; Because He has looked upon the lowliness, of His handmaid; <br>


<br>


Because He who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is His
name. And His mercy is from generation to generation on those who fear
Him.<br>


<br>


He has won victory with His arm, He has scattered the proud in the
conceit of their heart. He has put down the mighty from their thrones,
and has exalted the lowly.<br>


<br>


He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich He has sent
empty away. He has given help to Israel His servant, mindful of His
mercy. Even as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and His seed forever.<br>

Praise Him, sun and moon; praise Him, all stars of light; praise Him,
heaven of heavens, and the waters above the heavens: let them praise

to Him with the harp: for the Lord takes pleasure in His people, and
gives salvation to the poor.<br>

Let the just exult in glory, let them praise Him on their beds: let the
high praises of God be in their throats, and two-edged swords in their
hands.<br>

To execute vengeance on the nations, and to rebuke the peoples; to bind
their kings with chains, their nobles with fetters of iron, to execute
on them the judgment which is written: that is the glory of the just.<br>

rather have taken away, the sin of the world have mercy upon us.<br>


<br>


You who take away, or rather have taken away, the sin of the world,
incline Your ear to us and receive our prayers;<br>
<br>
You who sit in glory at
the right hand of the Father, have compassion on us.<br>


<br>


Because You only are holy, You only Lord Jesus Christ, with the Holy Spirit, in the glory of God the Father. Amin.<br>


<br>


At all times and all the days of my life, I will bless and praise Your
name, which is holy and blessed forever, and which remains forever and
ever.<br>


<br>


Blessed are You, Lord almighty, God of our fathers, and Your name is blessed and glorified in praise forever.<br>


<br>


To You belongs glory, to You belongs praise, to You belongs honor, God
of all, Father of truth, with the only Son and living Holy Spirit, now
and always forever. Amen.<br>


<br>


Lord Jesus Christ Do not shut the door of mercy in our faces, Lord; we
confess that we are sinners, have mercy upon us. Your love made You
descend from Your place to us, Lord, by whose death our death was
ended; have mercy upon us.<br>

Lord's Prayer</span><br>


<br>


Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread: and forgive us our debts and sins, as we also have
forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
the evil one. For Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory,
forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.<br>

Hail, Mary, full of Grace, our Lord is with thee; blessed art thou

Christ. Oh Virgin Saint Mary, Oh Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at all times, and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br>
