<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Awaken us</span>, Lord, from our
sleep in the sloth of sin that we may praise your watchfulness, you who
watch and do not sleep; give life to our death in the sleep of death
and corruption, that we may adore your compassion, you who live and do
not die; grant us in the glorious company of the angels who praise you
in heaven, to praise you and bless you in holiness, because you are
praised and blessed in heaven and on earth, Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit, now and always and forever. Amen. <br>

<br>
Bless the Lord, all you servants of the Lord.<br>
<br>
You who stand by night in the house of the Lord.<br>
<br>
May the Lord bless you from Zion, He who made heaven and earth.<br>
<br>
Let my praise enter before You, Lord, and give me life by Your word; let my cry enter before You, <br>
<br>
My tongue shall pour forth Your word, because all Your commands are just.<br>
<br>
My lips shall speak Your praise when You have taught me Your commands;
let Your hand help me because I have taken pleasure in Your commands.<br>
<br>
My soul has longed for Your salvation and I have meditated on Your law;
let my soul live and I will praise You and Your judgments shall help me.<br>
<br>
I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek for Your servant, because I have not forgotten all Your commands<br>
<br>
Praise the Lord, all you nations, praise Him, all you peoples; because His grace is strong over us, the <br>
Lord is truly forever. <br>

I will sing of the virgin, who became by grace the mother of him who

Blessed are you, who nourished with your pure milk, like a child, the
breast from which the world sucks life and light; blessed are, the day

Mary said: My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God,
my Savior; Because He has looked upon the lowliness, of His handmaid; <br>
<br>
Because He who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is His
name. And His mercy is from generation to generation on those who fear
Him.<br>
<br>
He has won victory with His arm, He has scattered the proud in the
conceit of their heart. He has put down the mighty from their thrones,
and has exalted the lowly.<br>
<br>
He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich He has sent
empty away. He has given help to Israel His servant, mindful of His
mercy. Even as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and His seed forever.<br>

<br>
Praise Him, sun and moon; praise Him, all stars of light; praise Him,
heaven of heavens, and the waters above the heavens: let them praise

<br>
Let them praise His name with the timbrel and the drum, let them sing
to Him with the harp: for the Lord takes pleasure in His people, and
gives salvation to the poor.<br>
<br>
Let the just exult in glory, let them praise Him on their beds: let the
high praises of God be in their throats, and two-edged swords in their
hands.<br>
<br>
To execute vengeance on the nations, and to rebuke the peoples; to bind
their kings with chains, their nobles with fetters of iron, to execute
on them the judgment which is written: that is the glory of the just.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Psalm 150</span><br>

Praise the Lord in His holy place, praise Him in the firmament of His strength.<br>

greatness, praise Him with the sound of the trumpet, praise Him with
lyre and harp.<br>

Hail, Mary, full of Grace, our Lord is with thee; blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, our Lord Jesus
Christ. Oh Virgin Saint Mary, Oh Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at all times, and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br>
