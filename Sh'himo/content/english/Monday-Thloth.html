<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lord's Prayer</span><br>
<br>
Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread: and forgive us our debts and sins, as we also have
forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
the evil one. For Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory,
forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hail Mary</span><br>
<br>
Hail, Mary, full of Grace, our Lord is with thee; blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, our Lord Jesus
Christ. Oh Virgin Saint Mary, Oh Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at all times, and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Introductory Prayer of Third Hour</span><br>
<br>
Cleanse us, Lord, by repentance and by tears of compunction from every
passion and stain and defilement of sin, and grant us the grace of
victory in our lives at all times and for all the days of our life,
Father, Son &amp; Holy Spirit, now and always and forever, Amen.<br>
<br>

Our Father in heaven, answer us when we call upon you, because we have
no other father who can help us. For when we did not exist, you were
pleased to create us, and now that we have come to be, let not your
anger destroy us. Teach us, Lord, your commandments, that we may keep
them and by deeds of justice let us please you, Lord, halleluia, in
your mercy have pity on us. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br>
I sin and hide myself that man may not see me. But when I do wicked
things, the Lord, sees me. If a man sees me, I am ashamed of it, but I
am not afraid of God. You are the great judge of judges Lord; whether a
man hastens or whether he delays, he is delivered into your hands,
halleluia, in your mercy have pity on us.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
It grieves me that I am yours in name only and by my deeds and faults I
am far from you. The desire is with me that I should be repentant, but
my obstinate will not let me; I teach but I do not learn; I give others
to drink but I am thirsty; Spring, which the lance opened, quench my
thirst, halleluia, that I may drink and be satisfied. <br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">B’outho of Mar Jacob </span><br>
<br>
We call upon you, Lord our Lord, come to our help; hear our petition and have mercy on our souls.<br>
<br>
I beseech you, my Lord, that I may not be separated from your company;
where iniquity has driven me out, let your sweet love make me enter.
Sin lay in wait for me and crushed me hard without mercy; you who are
skilled, bind up the bruises with which I am wounded. <br>
<br>
The wicked one has hunted me and, behold, he strangles me in his net;
break his net and I shall escape from his attack. Good Shepherd, go out
in search of the sheep that has strayed, and do not leave it in the
hands of the wicked one, who seeks its life.<br>
<br>
Answer, Lord, answer, Lord, have mercy upon us and turn the hearts of the sons of men to repentance.<br>
