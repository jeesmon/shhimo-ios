Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread: and forgive us our debts and sins, as we also have
forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
the evil one. For Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory,
forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.<br>




<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">



Hail Mary</span><br>




<br>




Hail, Mary, full of Grace, our Lord is with thee; blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, our Lord Jesus
Christ. Oh Virgin Saint Mary, Oh Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at all times, and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br>




<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">



Introductory Prayer of Third Hour</span><br>




<br>

passion and stain and defilement of sin, and grant us the grace of
victory in our lives at all times and for all the days of our life,
Father, Son &amp; Holy Spirit, now and always and forever, Amen.<br>

Blessed is blessed Mary, the mother who brought forth God, and on her
knees bore and carried him who is the lamb of God, and she was not
harmed by his radiance nor by the fervor of his fire, because his
strength supported her and she carried him, to who chariot, which
carries him, the cherubim are yoked.<br>




<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">



Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">



Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">




<br>




By the three mysteries the Church taught a lesson to unbelievers, a
tree, a rock, and a fish, which grave unaccustomed fruit; the tree
brought forth a lamb, the rock flowed with water and the fish gave
forth a coin; these reprove him who doubts child-bearing of these
blessed virgin.<br>

B’outho of Mar Jacob</span><br>




<br>




May your prayer be with us, blessed on, may your prayer be with us; may the Lord hear your prayers and have pity on us.<br>




<br>




With wonder will I speak concerning Mary, while I wonder at the great
height to which the daughter of the depths ascended; grace made the Son
descend to her, and she found favor, so as to become the mother of the
Son of God.<br>




<br>




In whom indeed shall I dwell but in the gentle and humble?&nbsp; He looked
upon her and dwelt in her who was humble among the children of men; for
no one was ever so humble as Mary, and it is manifest that none was
ever so exalted as she was.<br>




<br>




By the prayers of her who carried you for nine months, Son of God, remove from us the scourge of wrath.&nbsp; <br>
