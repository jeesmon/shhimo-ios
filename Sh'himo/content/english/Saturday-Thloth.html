<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lord's Prayer</span><br>
<br>
Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread: and forgive us our debts and sins, as we also have
forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
the evil one. For Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory,
forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hail Mary</span><br>
<br>
Hail, Mary, full of Grace, our Lord is with thee; blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, our Lord Jesus
Christ. Oh Virgin Saint Mary, Oh Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at all times, and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Introductory Prayer of Third Hour</span><br>
<br>
Cleanse us, Lord, by repentance and by tears of compunction from every
passion and stain and defilement of sin, and grant us the grace of
victory in our lives at all times and for all the days of our life,
Father, Son &amp; Holy Spirit, now and always and forever, Amen.<br>
<br>

<br>
</span>Pardon your priests, Lord, halleluia.<br>
May the priests and deacons, who served you, Lord, in the churches and
the monasteries in their life time at your holy altar, at which they
carried in their hands your body and your innocent blood for the pardon
of their offences, have their offences pardoned by your body and their
sins forgiven by your blood, and may they cry at your right hand, glory
to you, O Lord.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
Lovely is the word of our Lord which he spoke to Simon, the head of the
apostles, concerning the priesthood: behold, I have made you the master
of the house and I have given into your hands the keys of the heights,
and the depths, that you may bind and loose; it you bind, I will bind,
and if you loose, I will loose, and it you pray for sinners your prayer
shall be heard.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">B’outho of Mar Jacob</span><br>
<br>
Give rest to your priests among the just, Son of God, in that kingdom which has no end among the saints.<br>
<br>
Death has trodden the glory of the priests in the dwelling of Sheol and
has gathered the splendor of the deacons into her citadel; the friends
of the bridegroom in the Church have become today dust in Sheol and the
sound of their harps is silent and has ceased.<br>
<br>
May the priests, who have departed rejoice with You, Son of God, and
may they be gladdened by you, when you come in the glory of your
Father; may our brothers and our teachers, who have passed from us sit
down in your kingdom with your saints.<br>
<br>
Christ, who are the Lord of priests and the great high-priest, pardon your priests, who served your mysteries, glory to you.<br>
