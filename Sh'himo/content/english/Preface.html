&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What does the word “Sh’himo” mean? </span><br>
<br>
“Sh’himo” is the Syriac word for “common” or “ordinary.”&nbsp; It
simply refers to the prayers that are done on ordinary days (outside of
the three day fast of Nineveh and the Great Fast) when there is not an
important feast of the Church being celebrated. The Sh’himo prayers do
not include Sunday, as every Sunday is a festal day on which we
celebrate the Resurrection (<span style="font-style: italic;">Qyomtho</span>) of our Lord. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What are the seven times of prayer?<br>
<br>
</span>The Church has developed seven liturgical hours of prayer.&nbsp;
It was King David, the Psalmist, who wrote, “Seven times a day I praise
You, because of Your righteous judgments” (<span style="font-style: italic;">Psalm 119:164</span>).&nbsp; The hours of prayer are as follows:<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">When does the liturgical day begin?</span><br>
<br>
In the Creation account we read: “that God called the light Day, and
the darkness He called Night. So the evening and the morning were the
first day” (Gen. 1:5).&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Syriac tradition, the day
begins with the evening (generally after 6PM).&nbsp; For example,
Monday Vespers would be observed on Sunday evening, Tuesday Vespers on
Monday evening, etc. <br>

The third, sixth and ninth hours are associated with our Fall and
Salvation. They are decisive moments in the history of salvation. This
is particular because at the third hour our Lord received judgment from
Pilate; at the sixth hour Christ was crucified and the ninth hour our
Lord gave His spirit up into the hands of His Father.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What are the themes that correlate to each day?</span><br>
<br>
The Sh’himo Prayers have general themes that correspond to each day of the week: <br>

<br>
On Friday, we remember the Cross as it was on Friday when our Lord was
crucified.&nbsp; We also remember the Martyrs and Confessors who
suffered for the love of Christ. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Saturday, we remember all the faithful departed. It was on Holy
Saturday when our Lord entered into Hades and preached the Gospel to
the departed ones. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Every Sunday, we celebrate the feast of feasts, the Resurrection of our Lord. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How should we pray the Sh’himo?</span><br>
<br>
1. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pray while standing</span> - One of
the main prayers we say throughout the Sh’himo is the “Qauma.”&nbsp; It
is familiar to many of us as it begins with “Holy art Thou O God, Holy
art Thou Immortal…”&nbsp; The word “Qauma” means “standing.”&nbsp; We
stand in prayer as we are acknowledging the presence of God.&nbsp; We
stand as a sign of reverence and respect.<br>
<br>
2. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Kneeling during prayer</span> - We
kneel to show our submission to our Lord.&nbsp; For example, when we
say “Crucified for us, have mercy on us”, we should kneel and make the
sign of the Cross.&nbsp; In this book, when we see “†”, we are reminded
to kneel and make the sign of the Cross.&nbsp; We do not kneel for the
liturgical prayers on Sunday in commemoration of the joyous
Resurrection of our Lord.<br>
<br>
3. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Facing east during prayer</span> -
When we pray we should face east as it is a sign of awaiting and
anticipating our Lord’s glorious second coming.&nbsp; Christ says, “For
as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so also
will the coming of the Son of Man be” (Matt. 24:27). <br>
<br>
Standing, kneeling, making the sign of the cross, and facing east are
all ways that we worship and pray with our bodies.&nbsp; We believe
that the Holy Spirit has sanctified our bodies as the Temple of God (1
Cor. 6:19).&nbsp; Christ, in His Resurrection, gave us hope in the
resurrection of both the body and the soul.&nbsp; Therefore, our
bodies, along with our hearts and minds, are called to participate in
prayer. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Our life as a Christian should be in communion with God, Who is
love.&nbsp; In our communion with God, we are also brought into
communion with those who loved God during their lifetime: the Saints
and the faithful departed as well as our faithful brethren on this
earth.&nbsp; Prayer for the Orthodox is personal, yet communal. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
The canonical prayer has a place in God’s plan for our salvation. The
liturgical hours gives us a foretaste of the life in the kingdom, where
we will glorify God unceasingly. The Church has developed the Sh’himo
prayers as a tool to help us organize our life around prayer.&nbsp;
While this is only an abridged version of the Sh’himo evening prayers,
may this help to strengthen the prayer life in our homes and our
communion with God.<br>
