<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lord's Prayer</span><br>
<br>
Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread: and forgive us our debts and sins, as we also have
forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
the evil one. For Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory,
forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hail Mary</span><br>
<br>
Hail, Mary, full of Grace, our Lord is with thee; blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, our Lord Jesus
Christ. Oh Virgin Saint Mary, Oh Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at all times, and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Introductory Prayer of Ramsho</span><br>
<br>
Grant us, Lord God, that while our bodies rest from the labors of the
day and our souls are released from worldly thoughts, we may stand in
your presence with tranquility at this time of evening and that we may
offer you ceaseless praise and uninterrupted thanksgiving; that we may
acknowledge your loving kindness by which you direct and rule our
lives, and protect and save our souls; to you we offer praise and
thanksgiving, now and always and forever. Amen<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Psalms of Ramsho (Ps. 141, 142, 119:105-112, 117)</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Kurielaison</span> Lord, I have called upon you, answer me: hear and receive my words.<br>
<br>
Let my prayer be like incense in your sight, the offering of my hands
like the evening offering.&nbsp; Set a guard, Lord, before my mouth, a
guard before my lips that my heart may not turn to evil words and I may
not do deeds of wickedness.<br>
<br>
Let me not take salt with impious men; let the just man teach me and
reprove me: let not the oil of the impious anoint my head; because my
prayer was against their evil-doing: their judges have been restrained
by the side of the rock; and they have heard how gentle are my words. <br>
<br>
As when a plough cleaves the earth their bones have been scattered at
the mouth of Sheol.&nbsp; I have lifted my eyes to you, Lord, and in
you have I put my trust, do not cast away my soul.<br>
<br>
Keep me from the hand of the proud, who have laid snares for me; let the wicked fall into their nets, while I pass on.<br>
With my voice I cried to the Lord; with my voice I besought the Lord
and poured my prayer before him; I showed him my affliction, when my
spirit was troubled, but you know my path.<br>
In the way of my walking they have laid a snare for me; I look to the
right and see none that knows me: the way of escape has gone from me
and there is none who cares for my soul, I cried to you, Lord, and
said: you are my hope and my portion in the land of the living.<br>
<br>
Hear my petition because I am brought very low; deliver me from my
persecutors because they are too strong for me.&nbsp; Lead me forth
from prison that I may give thanks to your name: your just ones shall
have hope when you shall reward me.<br>
<br>
Your word is a lamp to my feet and light to my path; I have sworn and
am resolved to keep the judgments of your justice.&nbsp; I am greatly
brought low, Lord, give me life according to your word; be pleased with
the words of my mouth, Lord, and teach me your judgments.<br>
<br>
My soul is ever in my hands, and I have no forgotten your law; sinners
have laid snares for me and I have not strayed from your
commands.&nbsp; I shall inherit your testimony forever because it is
dear to my heart; I have turned my heart to do your commands forever in
truth.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Praise the Lord, all you nations; praise him, all you peoples; for his grace is strong over us, truly the Lord is forever.<br>
<br>
And to you belongs the praise, O God. Barekmor.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>

</span>He who bears the whole creation was borne by the wood of the
cross; the living one and the giver of life tasted death of his own
will; he, whom the boundaries of the world cannot hold and the creation
cannot contain rested in the tomb; the hero of the world reclined among
the dead. <span style="font-style: italic;">Stomen Kalos, Kurielaison</span><br>

</span><span style="font-style: italic;">May your prayer be a stronghold to us</span><br>
Virgin Mary, who were chosen from among all generations to be the
mother of God, pray and beseech your Son, that he may have mercy upon
us all by your prayer.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen</span><br>
<br>
Glory be to the Father, Worship to the Son and thanksgiving to the
Spirit, glorious Trinity, three Persons, three names, one true God, to
him be praise.<br>
<br>
Mary said: blessed am I who brought forth the King; the kings of the
earth worship him and I have been made the nurse of him, who by his
gesture rules the ends and the quarters of the world.<br>
<br>
On the day of the remembrance of the blessed virgin Mary all creatures
rejoice and sing praise to the Lord, who chose her and honored and
magnified the glorious day of her remembrance.<br>
<br>
Blessed are the prophets, blessed are the apostles, blessed are the
martyrs, on the great day of the resurrection; they shall hear the
Father and shall see the Son and the Holy Spirit, who weaves crowns for
their heads.<br>
<br>
The martyrs say to their persecutors: we do not fear the fire or the
sharpened sword and, of the body perishes, the soul shall live and sing
praise and thanksgiving.<br>
<br>
Blessed is he who loves you, Lord more than gold or precious stones; in
this world great will be his honor and in that which is to come he
shall inherit life forever.<br>
<br>
Our Lord said to the sinful woman: Go, woman, your offences and sins
are forgiven; amen, amen I say to you, that among those who proclaim my
name in the gospel I will write of you.<br>
<br>
Give rest, Lord, to your servants in that kingdom, which does not pass
away or come to an end; and write their names in the book of life in
that Jerusalem, which is in heaven.<br>
<br>
At the time of our decease neither father nor mother nor brother nor
kinsmen can save us; Christ will never leave the departed, who dwell in
the grave, in Sheol, nor fail to raise them up.<br>

</span><span style="font-style: italic;">You created me and placed your hands upon me</span><br>
On Friday in the beginning God created Adam from the dust and breathed
on him the spirit and gave him speech, that he might sing praise to
him, halleluia, and give thanks to his creator.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
Glory to the strong one, who descended from the heights and redeemed us
by his cross and delivered us from the curse and taught us to worship
his exalted cross, halleluia and halleluia, to bless and worship it.<br>
<br>
Blessed are you, daughter of the just, mother of God, because mercy was
shown to you and you found favor and you bore God; and he has magnified
your memory, halleluia and halleluia, in heaven and on earth.<br>
<br>
Mary and Elizabeth were wondrous ships, who sailed into harbor;
Elizabeth brought forth the preacher and Mary the Savior of the world,
halleluia and halleluia, may their prayer assist us.<br>
<br>
Blessed are the prophets, blessed are the apostles, blessed are the
martyrs, and blessed are they who without stain in the way of the Lord,
halleluia and halleluia, and who keep his commandments.<br>
<br>
Martyrs, beg for mercy for our generation which has sinned, that by
your prayers we may be protected and Satan may be put to shame and his
army be overthrown&nbsp; by the power of your prayers, halleluia and
halleluia, may your prayers assist us.<br>
<br>
Joshua, the son of Nun, stopped the sun un the firmament and the moon
did not move; keep, Lord, from your church all scourges by the prayer
of Mar (X), halleluia and halleluia, and of the apostles who are his
fellows.<br>
<br>
On Friday the Lord of creation stretched out his hands on the cross and
instead of the fruit, which Adam ate, tasted death of his won will,
halleluia and halleluia, and restored him to his inheritance.<br>
<br>
From day to day I promise, Lord, that tomorrow I will repent; my days
have passed and gone and my sins remain; may your mercy be poured out
upon me, halleluia and halleluia, and I will live by your grace. <br>
<br>
Extend, Lord, your grace and let your bounty flow over the whole world;
grant reconciliation to kings, peace to the churches, and concord to
the priests, halleluia and halleluia, and to us forgiveness of sins.<br>
<br>
Those who died in the Sons, who kept his commandments and confessed and
believed in him, at his second coming shall inherit the kingdom and
life which does not pass away, halleluia and halleluia, and there they
shall take their pleasure.<br>
<br>
By the smoke of incense, which Aaron offered, he stayed the plague; and
may the smoke of incense, which the priests offer to you, be
propitiation to you, halleluia and halleluia, and give rest to our
departed.<br>

</span>O holy martyrs, who endured torments and afflictions from
impious judges, behold, your reward is kept for you in the
marriage-chamber of light, which does not pass away; may your prayer be
a high wall and a house of refuge for us. <span style="font-style: italic;">Stomen Kalos, Kurielaison</span>.<br>

<br>
</span>Martyrs of the only Son, you are beloved of the first born of
the most High, who for his sake were slain and for his love endured
sufferings and for him were offered in sacrifice; blessed is he who has
magnified your memory.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen</span><br>
<br>
Glory to you, Lord, because in all generations are just men who appease
your name; in the first ages Noah, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and Moses
and Elijah; and in the age the blessed martyrs will intercede with you
by the blood which flowed from their necks.<br>

<br>
Make us to share, Lord, in the memory of your mother and of your
saints; by their prayers have pity on us, Lord, and on our departed.<br>
<br>
How fair and lovely is the day of the remembrance of the blessed virgin
Mary, who became the mother of the Son of God; by her prayers may the
Lord remove the rod of wrath from every place which keeps her festival
in faith.<br>
<br>
How fair and lovely is the good hope, which our Lord gave to the dead
in Sheol, when he lay down like them beside them; behold, death is
slain, rise and come forth, you dead, from within the grave, and sing
praise to him who raised you up from destruction.<br>
<br>
Above in heaven and here in the Church on earth may there be a
remembrance of the blessed one and of the saints and of the faithful
departed.<br>

O Jesus Christ our Lord, close not the door of Thy mercy upon our

O Lord, Thy love for us, didst make Thee to come down to us from Thy
place.&nbsp; That by Thy death, our death might be abolished; Have
mercy upon us. Amen.<br>
