Lord's Prayer</span><br>




<br>




Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread: and forgive us our debts and sins, as we also have
forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
the evil one. For Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory,
forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.<br>




<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">



Hail Mary</span><br>




<br>




Hail, Mary, full of Grace, our Lord is with thee; blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, our Lord Jesus
Christ. Oh Virgin Saint Mary, Oh Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at all times, and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br>




<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">



Introductory Prayer of Third Hour</span><br>




<br>




Cleanse us, Lord, by repentance and by tears of compunction from every
passion and stain and defilement of sin, and grant us the grace of
victory in our lives at all times and for all the days of our life,
Father, Son &amp; Holy Spirit, now and always and forever, Amen.<br>

<br>




In parables spoke our Savior and in allegories and in dark sayings, and
he said: the kingdom of heaven is like those virgins who took lamps and
went forth to meet the bridegroom and the bride; and they slumbered and
slept together. And there was a great cry: behold the bridegroom comes.
The wise entered with him and the foolish remained at the door in great
sorrow and with unutterable sighs. <br>




<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">



Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">



Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>




<br>




The only begotten Word of the Father composed parables for our help,
and he said: There was a rich man who lived luxuriously in pleasure and
a poor man Lazarus desired to be satisfied with food; and when he died
the angels carried him to the bosom of our father Abraham. And the rich
man also died and went to torment and inherited woe forever in Gehenna,
because he had not compassion on his own flesh.<br>

B’outho of Mar Jacob </span><br>




<br>




We call upon you, Lord our Lord, come to our help; hear our petition and have mercy on our souls.<br>




<br>




The sick soul says in her pain: who will give me that beauty with which
I have clothed before I sinned?&nbsp; If God who is merciful will not accept
me, whom shall I find to restore me to the beauty which I have lost? <br>




<br>




Come, my soul, image of the king, you have lost your beauty: behold in
the hands of your Lord your beauty is kept for you; the moment that
you come he will give it you as he promised; he has kept it carefully
and it is preserved for you that it may be restored to you.<br>




<br>




Answer Lord, answer Lord, have mercy upon us and turn the hearts of the sons of men to repentance.&nbsp; <br>
