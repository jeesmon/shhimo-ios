<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lord's Prayer</span><br>
<br>
Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread: and forgive us our debts and sins, as we also have
forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
the evil one. For Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory,
forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hail Mary</span><br>
<br>
Hail, Mary, full of Grace, our Lord is with thee; blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, our Lord Jesus
Christ. Oh Virgin Saint Mary, Oh Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at all times, and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Introductory Prayer of Sapro</span><br>
<br>
Creator of the morning, who drive out the darkness and bring light and
joy to the creation; create in us habits of virtue and drive from us
all the darkness of sin; give us light and joy by the glorious rays of
your grace, Lord our God, forever. Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Psalms 51</span><br>
<br>
Have mercy on me, God, in your loving kindness; in the abundance of your mercy blot out my sin.<br>
<br>
Wash me thoroughly from my guilt and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my fault and my sins are before me always.<br>
<br>
Against you only have I sinned and done evil in your sight, that you
may be justified in your words and vindicated in your judgment. For I
was born in guilt and in sin did my mother conceive me.<br>
<br>
But you take pleasure in truth and you have made known to me the
secrets of your wisdom. Sprinkle me with your hyssop and I shall be
clean; wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.<br>
<br>
Give me the comfort of your joy and gladness, and the bones which have
been humbled shall rejoice. Turn away your face from my sins and blot
out all my faults.<br>
<br>
Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew your steadfast spirit
within me. Do not cast me from your presence and take not your Holy
Spirit from me. <br>
But restore to me your joy and your salvation and let your glorious
spirit sustain me; that I may teach the wicked your way and sinners may
return to you.<br>
<br>
Deliver me from blood, O God, God of my salvation, and my tongue
shall praise your justice.&nbsp; Lord , open my lips and my mouth shall
sing your praise.<br>
<br>
For you do not take pleasure in sacrifices; by burnt offerings you are
not appeased. The sacrifice of God is a humble spirit, a heart that is
contrite will not despise.<br>
<br>
Do good in your good pleasure to Zion and build up the walls of
Jerusalem. Then shall you be satisfied with sacrifices of truth and
with whole burnt-offerings; then shall they offer bullocks upon your
altar. And to you belongs the praise, O God.<br>
<br>
And to you belongs the praise, O God, Barekmor.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Psalm 63</span><br>
<br>
My God, you are my God, I will seek you.<br>
<br>
My soul thirsts for you and my flesh seeks for you like the thirsty earth which is parched and begging for water.<br>
<br>
So have I looked for you in truth, that I may see your power and your glory.<br>
<br>
Because your loving kindness is better than life and my lips shall praise you.<br>
<br>
So I will bless you while I live and will lift up my hands in your name.<br>
<br>
My soul shall be enriched as with marrow and fat and my mouth shall praise you with lips of praise.<br>
<br>
I have remembered you upon my bed and in the night time I have meditated on you.<br>
<br>
For you have been my helper and in the shadow of your wings is my protection.<br>
<br>
My soul follows after you and your right hand upholds me.<br>
<br>
Those who seek to destroy my soul shall enter into the lower parts of the earth.<br>
<br>
They shall be delivered over to the sword and shall be food for foxes; but the king shall rejoice in God.<br>
<br>
Everyone who swears by him shall glory, but the mouth of those who speak lies shall be stopped.<br>
<br>
And to you belongs the praise, O God, Barekmor.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

</span>The cross is a token of peace; the cross is a sign of victory; it is the cross by which we are saved and in which we all glory.<br>
<br>
In the camp of Israel the serpent of bronze was set up as a figure and a surety of the cross which brings life.<br>
<br>
By your cross, Lord Jesus, and by the prayer of the Mother who bore You, remove and banish from us the scourge and rod of wrath.<br>
<br>
By your cross, Lord Jesus, and by the prayer of Mary who bore you, make
you peace and tranquility dwell in the four quarters of the creation. <br>

which the patriarchs, the prophets, apostles and martyrs ascended.<br>
The cross has conquered, the cross conquers, the cross has conquered
the enemy, may the cross be a stronghold to all who confess the cross.<br>

The cross reigns in heaven, the cross reigns on earth, may the cross be a stronghold to the churches and monasteries.<br>

<br>
We will not fear the evil one, because the Lord is with us, and we are clothed in his strong armor and in it we all glory.<br>
<br>
In your cross, Lord Jesus, we take refuge every day, which delivers us
from the evil one and makes us inherit the kingdom on high.<br>
<br>
May he, who carried the cross on his shoulder and went forth from Zion,
sprinkle the dew of his mercy on the bones of the departed.<br>
<br>
May the promise, which was received from you by the thief on the summit
of the wood, be received by the departed who confessed the Trinity.<br>

<br>
Praise, you servants of the Lord, praise the name of the Lord.<br>

May the Lord's name be blessed forever and forever.<br>
<br>
From the rising of the sun to its setting great is the name of the Lord.<br>
<br>
The Lord is high above all peoples and his glory is above the heavens.<br>
<br>
Who is like the Lord, our God, who sits on high and looks upon the depths in heaven and on earth?<br>
<br>
He raises up the poor from the dunghill, and makes him sit with the princes of the people.<br>
<br>
He makes the barren woman keep house and be a joyful mother of children. <br>
<br>
And to you belongs the praise, O God, Barekmor.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

will one earth.<br>

to you, Lord.<br>

you, do you acknowledge us, Jesus, Savior of the world. <br>
