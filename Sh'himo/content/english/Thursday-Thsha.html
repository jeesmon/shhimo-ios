Receive, Lord, the souls of your servants in tabernacles of light and
make them to dwell in the harbor of blessedness; give them rest in the
glorious bosom of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the Patriarchs, that on
the great day of your glorious manifestation we may stand with them at
your right hand, and offer fitting praise to you and your Father and
your Holy Spirit, now and always and forever, Amen.<br>
<br>

</span>Those who died in the Son, who kept his commandments and
confessed and believed in him, at his second coming shall inherit the
kingdom and life which does not pass away, halleluiah and halleluiah,
and there they shall take their pleasure.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

halleluiah and halleluiah, to the Lord who raises them up.<br>

Renew, full of mercy, your creatures by the resurrection, <br>

<br>
Give rest to those in the grave, heavenly King, and multiply forgiveness to the faithful departed.<br>
<br>
In the bosom of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob make them rest, Lord, your servants who have slept in your hope.<br>
Glory to Christ who calls the dead and they rise without corruption and sing praise.<br>

Their bodies and their souls shall cry together: blessed is he who has come and will come and raise the dead.<br>
