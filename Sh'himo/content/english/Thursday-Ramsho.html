<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lord's Prayer</span><br>
<br>
Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread: and forgive us our debts and sins, as we also have
forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
the evil one. For Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory,
forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.<br>
<br>
Hail Mary<br>
Hail, Mary, full of Grace, our Lord is with thee; blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, our Lord Jesus
Christ. Oh Virgin Saint Mary, Oh Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at all times, and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Introductory Prayer of Ramsho</span><br>
<br>
Grant us, Lord god, that while our bodies rest from the labors of the
day and our souls are released from worldly thoughts, we may stand in
your presence with tranquility at this time of evening and that we may
offer you ceaseless praise and uninterrupted thanksgiving; that we may
acknowledge your loving kindness by which you direct and rule our
lives, and protect and save our souls; to you we offer praise and
thanksgiving, now and always and forever. Amen<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Psalms of Ramsho (Ps. 141, 142, 119:105-112, 117)</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Kurielaison</span> Lord, I have called upon you, answer me: hear and receive my words.<br>
<br>
Let my prayer be like incense in your sight, the offering of my hands
like the evening offering.&nbsp; Set a guard, Lord, before my mouth, a
guard before my lips that my heart may not turn to evil words and I may
not do deeds of wickedness.<br>
<br>
Let me not take salt with impious men; let the just man teach me and
reprove me: let not the oil of the impious anoint my head; because my
prayer was against their evil-doing: their judges have been restrained
by the side of the rock; and they have heard how gentle are my words. <br>
<br>
As when a plough cleaves the earth their bones have been scattered at
the mouth of Sheol.&nbsp; I have lifted my eyes to you, Lord, and in
you have I put my trust, do not cast away my soul.<br>
<br>
Keep me from the hand of the proud, who have laid snares for me; let the wicked fall into their nets, while I pass on.<br>
With my voice I cried to the Lord; with my voice I besought the Lord
and poured my prayer before him; I showed him my affliction, when my
spirit was troubled, but you know my path.<br>
In the way of my walking they have laid a snare for me; I look to the
right and see none that knows me: the way of escape has gone from me
and there is none who cares for my soul, I cried to you, Lord, and
said: you are my hope and my portion in the land of the living.<br>
<br>
Hear my petition because I am brought very low; deliver me from my
persecutors because they are too strong for me.&nbsp; Lead me forth
from prison that I may give thanks to your name: your just ones shall
have hope when you shall reward me.<br>
<br>
Your word is a lamp to my feet and light to my path; I have sworn and
am resolved to keep the judgments of your justice.&nbsp; I am greatly
brought low, Lord, give me life according to your word; be pleased with
the words of my mouth, Lord, and teach me your judgments.<br>
<br>
My soul is ever in my hands, and I have no forgotten your law; sinners
have laid snares for me and I have not strayed from your
commands.&nbsp; I shall inherit your testimony forever because it is
dear to my heart; I have turned my heart to do your commands forever in
truth.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Praise the Lord, all you nations; praise him, all you peoples; for his grace is strong over us, truly the Lord is forever.<br>
<br>
And to you belongs the praise, O God. Barekmor.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

</span>Those in heaven sing praise and those on earth offer worship to
the one eternal Being, God the creator of the whole world. Stomen

<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">I called upon the Lord with my voice; with my voice I besought the Lord.</span><br>
With the voice of praise I make satisfaction to you; because of my
offences and sins I beseech you while I cry; my Lord and my God, do not
cast me from your presence; I lay before you my penitence and
compunction of heart; because of the multitude of my faults, Christ the
King, have mercy on me. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
Pardon my offences by your grace and forgive my fault. You are a God of
mercy, do not leave me to the enemy, that I may not be entangled in his
snare and those who know me mock at me and I become a laughing stock;
Christ my God, at your door have I knocked, have mercy on me.<br>
<br>
From the palace of heaven a Watcher was sent to Nazareth, a town of
Galilee, to the blessed daughter of David; he brought a message of
peace with him and announced to her: the Lord is with you and shall
come forth from you, the first-born of the Father; Christ God, who came
forth from her, have mercy upon us.<br>
<br>
All the mouths and tongues of fire and spirit which are in the hidden
heights above cry, blessed is the blessed one; and likewise all the
generations on earth, as she said; by her prayers, Lord of all, bestow
in your compassion forgiveness of offenses and sins upon the assembly
which honors the day of her memory.<br>
<br>
Peace be with the prophets, apostles, and martyrs,&nbsp; builders of
the faith and pillars of the holy Church, who endured all torments for
the sake of our Lord, and their souls followed after him, as David
sang; Christ God, by their prayers, have mercy upon us. <br>
<br>
Who is able to declare the praises of the martyrs, who love Christ with
all the strength of their soul, and hated the honor of this world which
passes and loved the fear of God with all their hearts? Christ God, by
the prayer of your martyrs, have mercy upon us. <br>
<br>
Open to us, Lord, the door of your mercy, as you did to the thief, and
accept our repentance, as you did that of the publican and the sinful
woman, and as your pardoned Simon after he had denied you, pardon our
offences and sins, Lord full of mercy, because you are he who is
pleased with penitents, when they come to you in penitence. <br>
<br>
The Ninevites trembled at the voice of Jonah, the son of Mathai, and
rook refuge in penitence by watching and fasting and prayer; and by
tears and groans the sentence of judgment was annulled which Jonah had
pronounced concerning the destruction of Nineveh; blessed be the
Compassionate one who turned them from evil to good.<br>
<br>
Make, Lord, a good memory of the faithful departed, who ate your holy
body and drank your propitiatory blood; and when you come in glory with
your angels, let them stand, Lord, at your right hand with faces
unveiled, Christ God, and let them offer praise to your godhead.<br>
<br>
King of Kings, weaver of crowns, who received a crown of thorns and
surrendered yourself to the cross and placed your soul in the hands of
the Father; make memory, Lord, of your servants who confessed your
name, and let them stand at your right hand, on the day when you
appear, and let them rejoice in the kingdom when you give reward to the
diligent.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">I will go to your house in reverence and pay my vows to you halleluia.</span><br>
In the evening we have come to your house, Lord, to ask for mercy,
compassion and forgiveness of sins; in the morning may we come and
worship you, our Savior, because you are he who has compassion on
sinners in their guilt.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
Glory to you, the Watcher whom the Watchers serve, who take pleasure in
the service of those on earth in your mercy; we call upon you from the
depths, hear our voice, as Jonah called upon you from within the sea
and you answered him. <br>
<br>
Blessed one, who became the mother of God in purity and holiness
without marriage, beg for mercy on this day of your remembrance, that
it may bring rest to the dead and hope to the living. <br>
<br>
Mary carried Christ on her knees and gave pure milk to suck to him, who
nourishes all things; she wrapped him in swaddling bands and laid him
in a manger, who united his godhead with our humanity.<br>
<br>
Peace be with your dwelling, holy ones, merchants who brought life to
the sons of men; open the treasury of your prayers to those in need and
keep the place in which you dwell from harm.<br>
<br>
Rise up, you martyrs and protect the creation from the waves and storms
which surround it; as Noah the just preserved in the ark the animals,
which entered with him on the day of the flood.<br>
<br>
Your splendor made those on high marvel, Mar (X) and your great name is
celebrated among those below; your Lord, when he saw the beauty of your
way of life, honored and magnified your memory; may your prayer be with
us. <br>
<br>
God, who are pure and a lover of the pure grant us purity of heart at
all times and remove from us vain concerns and all thoughts and cares
that are not pleasing to you.<br>
<br>
God, who had pity on Nineveh, have pity on us and do not turn your face
from our generation which has sinned; if you close your door in our
faces, Compassionate one, at what door shall we go to knock, if not at
your door.<br>
<br>
Raise the dead, who received your body, O our Savior, and drank the cup
of salvation, of your precious blood, raise them from the grave without
corruption and clothe them in glory, those who wait for you.<br>
<br>
Give, Lord, rest and life and gladness to the departed who ate your
flesh and drank your blood; may they behold your compassion at the seat
of judgment, when you come, and may they stand at the right hand of
your godhead.<br>
<br>

<br>
Lord, hear my prayer, halleluiah, and let my cry come before you. <br>
<br>
Because my days are consumed in smoke, halleluiah, and my bones are white as if they were burned.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>

</span>Receive, Lord, our service and our prayers like those of Moses
and Elijah and like those of Aaron the glorious priest, and to you
belongs the praise, O God. Stomen Kalos, Kurielaison.<br>

<br>
</span><span style="font-style: italic;">How good and lovely.</span><br>
The light of day is ending, bring to completion your grace in us;
remove from us the evil one who at every hour lays snares for us; may
your cross be our guard and protection by night and by day.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
Behold, the Watchers on high give ear to the voice of the service of
those on earth, and they say: how sweet is the voice of the children of
the earthly Adam, who sing praise with harps of the spirit and offer
thanksgiving.<br>

<br>
We call upon you, Lord our Lord, come to our help; hear our petition and have mercy on our souls.<br>
<br>
Lord, have pity on me and I will live by the mercy from your right
hand, and let me not be tormented like the rich man in Gehenna; grant
me to pass on a ship of water through the sea of fire, and let not the
grievous place of fire harm me.<br>
<br>
Let me not, Lord, beg for water there from Abraham, where it is known
that he who asks does not have it given him; if the path of fire is my
lot on account of the guilt of my hands, let me see you there like
Hananiah as a fourth amid the flames.<br>
<br>
Christ who have authority over the kingdom and over Gehenna, deliver us, Lord from Gehenna and have mercy upon us.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Concluding Prayer of Ramsho</span><br>
<br>
O Jesus Christ our Lord, close not the door of Thy mercy upon our
faces.&nbsp; We confess that we are sinners; have mercy upon us.&nbsp;
O Lord, Thy love for us, didst make Thee to come down to us from Thy
place.&nbsp; That by Thy death, our death might be abolished; Have
mercy upon us. Amen.<br>
