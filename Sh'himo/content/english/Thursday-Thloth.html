<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lord's Prayer</span><br>
<br>
Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread: and forgive us our debts and sins, as we also have
forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
the evil one. For Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory,
forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hail Mary</span><br>
<br>
Hail, Mary, full of Grace, our Lord is with thee; blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, our Lord Jesus
Christ. Oh Virgin Saint Mary, Oh Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at all times, and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Introductory Prayer of Third Hour</span><br>
<br>
Cleanse us, Lord, by repentance and by tears of compunction from every
passion and stain and defilement of sin, and grant us the grace of
victory in our lives at all times and for all the days of our life,
Father, Son &amp; Holy Spirit, now and always and forever, Amen.<br>
<br>

<br>
</span>Lord our Lord, where shall I go from your spirit or where shall
I hide from the presence of your majesty? If I ascend up on high, you
are there eternally; and if I descend to Sheol, your power is there. In
your mercy have compassion on me and make me stand at your right hand,
because no man living can be justified in your sight.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br>
Woe to me, because I was a diligent slave to evil and like a criminal
was unmindful of death; I trampled on the law and rose up against the
commandment and my own evil will was a law to me, and now I am deprived
of the garment of virtue and naked of the robe of glory. Have
compassion on me, Lord, by your passion and your death and your burial
and deliver me from Gehenna by your grace.&nbsp; <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">B’outho of Mar Jacob</span><br>
<br>
We call upon you, Lord our Lord, come to our help, hear our petition and have mercy on our souls.<br>
<br>
I long for your pardon, Lord, that it may come to me; give me tears to
beg for mercy while there is yet time; I am thirsty for your mercy and
without it I cannot stand; Sea of mercy, pour upon me streams of your
grace. <br>
<br>
My time has come to an end, while I labor at vanities; at the end of
time of life, grant that I may be yours. The king of error has rained
his arrows to cause my death; you are the lord of power, anoint me with
your medicine and I shall be cured. <br>
<br>
Answer, Lord, answer, Lord, and have mercy upon us, and turn the hearts of the sons of men to repentance.<br>
