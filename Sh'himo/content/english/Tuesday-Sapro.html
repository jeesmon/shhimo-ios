Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come;

forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
the evil one. For Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory,
forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.<br>

Introductory Prayer of Sapro</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">



<br>



Creator of the morning, who drive out the darkness and brings light and
joy to the creation; create in us habits of virtue and drive from us
all the darkness of sin; give us light and joy by the glorious rays of
your grace, Lord our God, forever. Amen.<br>



<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">


Psalms 51</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">



<br>



Have mercy on me, God, in your loving kindness; in the abundance of your mercy blot out my sin.<br>



<br>



Wash me thoroughly from my guilt and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my fault and my sins are before me always.<br>



<br>



Against you only have I sinned and done evil in your sight, that you
may be justified in your words and vindicated in your judgment. For I
was born in guilt and in sin did my mother conceive me.<br>



<br>



But you take pleasure in truth and you have made known to me the
secrets of your wisdom. Sprinkle me with your hyssop and I shall be
clean; wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.<br>



<br>



Give me the comfort of your joy and gladness, and the bones which have
been humbled shall rejoice. Turn away your face from my sins and blot
out all my faults.<br>



<br>



Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew your steadfast spirit
within me. Do not cast me from your presence and take not your Holy
Spirit from me. <br>



But restore to me your joy and your salvation and let your glorious
spirit sustain me; that I may teach the wicked your way and sinners may
return to you.<br>



<br>



Deliver me from blood, O God, God of my salvation, and my tongue
shall praise your justice.&nbsp; Lord , open my lips and my mouth shall sing
your praise.<br>



<br>



For you do not take 'pleasure in sacrifices; by burnt offerings you are
not appeased. The sacrifice of God is a humble spirit, a heart that is
contrite&nbsp;&nbsp; will not despise.<br>



<br>



Do good in your good pleasure to Zion and build up the walls of
Jerusalem. Then shall you be satisfied with sacrifices of truth and
with whole burnt-offerings; then shall they offer bullocks upon your
altar.<br>



<br>



And to you belongs the praise, O God, Barekmor.<br>



<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">


Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

<span style="font-weight: bold;">


Psalm 63</span><br>



<br>



My God, you are my God, I will seek you.<br>



<br>



My soul thirsts for you and my flesh seeks for you like the thirsty earth which is parched and begging for water.<br>



<br>



So have I looked for you in truth, that I may see your power and your glory.<br>



<br>



Because your loving kindness is better than life and my lips shall praise you.<br>



<br>



So I will bless you while I live and will lift up my hands in your name.<br>



<br>



My soul shall be enriched as with marrow and fat and my mouth shall praise you with lips of praise.<br>



<br>



I have remembered you upon my bed and in the night time I have meditated on you.<br>



<br>



For you have been my helper and in the shadow of your wings is my protection.<br>



<br>



My soul follows after you and your right hand upholds me.<br>



<br>



Those who seek to destroy my soul shall enter into the lower parts of the earth.<br>



<br>



They shall be delivered over to the sword and shall be food for foxes; but the king shall rejoice in God.<br>



<br>



Everyone who swears by him shall glory, but the mouth of those who speak lies shall be stopped.<br>



<br>



And to you belongs the praise, O God, Barekmor.<br>



<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">

<br>



You who have compassion on sinners and are pleased with those who repent, I have risen early before you, have mercy upon me. <br>

Praise, you servants of the Lord, praise the name of the Lord.<br>

<br>



From the rising of the sun to its setting great is the name of the Lord.<br>



<br>



The Lord is high above all peoples and his glory is above the heavens.<br>



<br>



Who is like the Lord, our God, who sits on high and looks upon the depths in heaven and on earth?<br>



<br>



He raises up the poor from the dunghill, and makes him sit with the princes of the people.<br>



<br>



He makes the barren woman keep house and be a joyful mother of children. <br>



<br>



And to you belongs the praise, O God, Barekmor.<br>

At the time of morning when the incense is offered, the angels on high

Glory to Christ, who sat by the well and under the pretext of water
caught the Samaritan woman; he asked water of her and she did not give
it him; and he caused to flow a fountain of the medicine of life and
quenched her thirst, halleluia and halleluia, and by the blood from his
side redeemed the Church and her children. <br>



<br>



We beseech you, blessed mother, to intercede for us with the Son who
came forth from you, that in his mercy he may blot out the record of
our offenses and that, when he comes at the end, he may not bring us to
judgment, halleluia and halleluia, may your prayer be a stronghold to
us and a house of refuge. <br>



<br>

Glory to Christ, who on the palm of his hands built the holy Church and
set up the altar in it and laid in it as foundations the prophets,
apostles, and holy martyrs, who triumphed and were crowned, halleluia
and halleuia, blessed is he who built his Church and made firm its
foundations. <br>



<br>



Tell me, martyrs, what was your expectation, that your bodies endure
such torments? Our expectation was what eye has not seen and what ear
has not heard and what has not entered into the heart, halleluia and
halleluia, that which God has promised to those who love him. <br>



<br>



The right hand of your Lord, Mar (X), has rested upon your flock, which

At the time of morning David went early to the house of God and began
to pray to him: Hear my words, Lord, and consider my meditation and
attend to the voice of my cry, Savior of the world, halleluia and
halleuia, and make me worthy of the pardon of the sins I have
committed. <br>



<br>



Let him who has sinned, sin no more, and let him who has not sinned, be
vigilant; for justice stands at the door and makes up the accounts and
holds a pen in her hand; she writes the deeds of every man and is no
respecter of person, halleluia and halleluia, you who know what is
hidden, have pity and mercy upon us.<br>



<br>



To you, Lord, we will come and on your door we will knock, and the
requests of all of us shall be granted by you; for he who asks receives
and he who seeks finds, and to him who knows at the door of mercy it is
opened, halleluia and halleluia, blessed is he whose door is opened to
sinners who repent.<br>



<br>



Let us remember in prayer the faithful departed and let us not forget
those who have departed from among us; let us remember their names at
the holy altar and at all times may rest be given to them, halleluia
and halleluia, and may they offer praise to you, who are their
resurrection. <br>



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>



By a sign from you, Lord, the children of Adam will be awakened at the

pleasing to your will.<br>

The peace of the Father was sent from on high by the hand of Gabriel to
blessed Mary; the mouth of the flaming one was full when he announced

you.<br>

Ezekiel, the prophet to the exile, saw with the eye of prophecy the
daughter of David and fashioned an image of her beauty by divine
revelation, which the Lord showed to him in a wondrous way.<br>

Peace be with you, prophets, peace be with you, apostles, and peace be
with you, martyrs, who loved the Lord of peace; and peace be with the
holy Church in which dwell the sons of peace. How becoming it is to
sing praise in this holy temple, in which are the prophets and apostles
and in which are the holy martyrs, and where the holy altar is set up,
the propitiation for the children of Adam. <br>



<br>



Not alone did you enter the arena, your martyrs, for your Lord entered
with you and gave courage to your minds, and when he saw your true
love, honored and magnified your memory.<br>



<br>



Our father, Mar (X), you acquired feathers and swift wings; by the
feathers you will win your reward and by the wings you will fly to the
heights, and you will go forth to meet your Lord by your life of
perfection.<br>

Lord, may your kingdom come, may your will be done on earth as it is in
heaven, forgive us our sins and offences and do not lead us into
temptation but deliver us from the evil one.<br>



<br>



O thief, tell us of the beauty of Paradise and show us the tree of life
that we may pluck first fruits from it, watching, fasting and prayer
and sacrifices of righteousness.<br>

Let us remember our fathers and brothers, who taught us when they were
living to be children of God; may the Son of God give them rest in the
kingdom of heaven with the just and the righteous.<br>



<br>



In the marriage-chamber of joyous light and in a place full of
gladness, give rest by your grace to those who have slept in your hope;
refresh them in that kingdom which does not pass away or come to an end.<br>

In the morning the creatures come and knock at your door, O
compassionate One; that you may give them from your treasure-house
compassion and mercy and forgiveness.<br>

It is good to give thanks to the Lord and to sing praise to your name
Most High; to proclaim in the morning your loving kindness and your
faithfulness in the night. Lord, in the morning you shall hear my voice
and in the morning I have prepared myself to appear before you. Lord, I
have compassion on your people, Lord, pardon and forgive the sins of us
all. Holy one, let your right hand rest upon us and pardon our
infirmity, because your name is forever.<br>
