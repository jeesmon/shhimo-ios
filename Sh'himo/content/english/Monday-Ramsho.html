<br>
Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread: and forgive us our debts and sins, as we also have
forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
the evil one. For Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory,
forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hail Mary</span><br>
<br>
Hail, Mary, full of Grace, our Lord is with thee; blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, our Lord Jesus
Christ. Oh Virgin Saint Mary, Oh Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at all times, and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Introductory Prayer of Ramsho</span><br>
<br>
Grant us, Lord god, that while our bodies rest from the labors of the
day and our souls are released from worldly thoughts, we may stand in
your presence with tranquility at this time of evening and that we may
offer you ceaseless praise and uninterrupted thanksgiving; that we may
acknowledge your loving kindness by which you direct and rule our
lives, and protect and save our souls; to you we offer praise and
thanksgiving, now and always and forever. Amen<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Psalms of Ramsho (Ps. 141, 142, 119:105-112, 117)</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Kurielaison</span> Lord, I have called upon you, answer me: hear and receive my words.<br>
<br>
Let my prayer be like incense in your sight, the offering of my hands
like the evening offering.&nbsp; Set a guard, Lord, before my mouth, a
guard before my lips that my heart may not turn to evil words and I may
not do deeds of wickedness.<br>
<br>
Let me not take salt with impious men; let the just man teach me and
reprove me: let not the oil of the impious anoint my head; because my
prayer was against their evil-doing: their judges have been restrained
by the side of the rock; and they have heard how gentle are my words. <br>
<br>
As when a plough cleaves the earth their bones have been scattered at
the mouth of Sheol.&nbsp; I have lifted my eyes to you, Lord, and in
you have I put my trust, do not cast away my soul.<br>
<br>
Keep me from the hand of the proud, who have laid snares for me; let the wicked fall into their nets, while I pass on.<br>
With my voice I cried to the Lord; with my voice I besought the Lord
and poured my prayer before him; I showed him my affliction, when my
spirit was troubled, but you know my path.<br>
In the way of my walking they have laid a snare for me; I look to the
right and see none that knows me: the way of escape has gone from me
and there is none who cares for my soul, I cried to you, Lord, and
said: you are my hope and my portion in the land of the living.<br>
<br>
Hear my petition because I am brought very low; deliver me from my
persecutors because they are too strong for me.&nbsp; Lead me forth
from prison that I may give thanks to your name: your just ones shall
have hope when you shall reward me.<br>
<br>
Your word is a lamp to my feet and light to my path; I have sworn and
am resolved to keep the judgments of your justice.&nbsp; I am greatly
brought low, Lord, give me life according to your word; be pleased with
the words of my mouth, Lord, and teach me your judgments.<br>
<br>
My soul is ever in my hands, and I have no forgotten your law; sinners
have laid snares for me and I have not strayed from your
commands.&nbsp; I shall inherit your testimony forever because it is
dear to my heart; I have turned my heart to do your commands forever in
truth.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Praise the Lord, all you nations; praise him, all you peoples; for his grace is strong over us, truly the Lord is forever.<br>
<br>
And to you belongs the praise, O God. Barekmor.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>

I have sinned against heaven and in your sight and I am not worthy to
be called your son: take me as a hired servant and let me be a servant
in your house, because I have sinned. Stoumen Kalos, Kurielaison<br>

Accept Lord this incense from our hands like the incense of Aaron, which kept away death from the people. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
Glory to you, Lord, whose praise is in heaven and on earth; those in heaven and those on earth praise your name.<br>
<br>
The archangel brought a greeting of peace to the daughter of David and
announced to her and said: the Lord is with you and shall come forth
from you. <br>
<br>
Mary was a ship; she bore, she carried, she was the eaden with the pilot who is the Lord of all creation.<br>
<br>
Holy prophets and apostles, sons of the kingdom, pray that we may not be drowned in the troubled sea of sin. <br>
<br>
Holy martyrs, servants of the most High God, may your prayers be for us a high wall and a house of refuge.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">The Lord is faithful in his words</span><br>
Your holy mouth has promised and said: call and I will answer; knock and I will open,<br>
<br>
Let us beg without ceasing, let us pray and not grow weary, while there is time to beg for mercy from our Lord.<br>
<br>
In the Jerusalem which is above and in the Church of those upon the
earth, make memory, Lord, of your servants, who have slept in your hope.<br>
<br>
Christ, full of mercy, let your sweet voice be heard by those who lie in the dust, who were clothed in you in baptism<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Our Lord Jesus Christ</span><br>
Not for judgment, Lord, and not for condemnation be to us your body and
your blood, which we have received, but for the pardon of sins and
forgiveness and for resurrection at your right hand, halleluiah, and
for an open face before you.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
The virgin, who was able to bear the hidden power which bears heaven
and earth, behold, she intercedes with Him by her prayer on behalf of
sinners, who call on her in faith, halleluiah, may her prayer be with
us.<br>
<br>
Our Lord called his disciples and commanded them: do not go in the way
of the Gentiles and do not enter into the house of the Samaritans and
do not draw near to the teaching of the Pharisees, halleluiah, cursed
be their teaching.<br>
<br>
More fair and lovely than the sun or the moon is your memory, O St.
(X); the sun gives light by day and the moon by night, but your beauty
at all times, halleluiah, may your prayer be with us.<br>
<br>
Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.<br>
Great is the day of Sunday and blessed is he who keeps it in faith;
because on it our Lord rose from the grave and the nations confessed
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, halleluiah, one God.<br>
<br>
David, the king and prophet, sang and said in the fifty first psalm,
have mercy on me, O God, and wash me thoroughly from the iniquity which
my hands have committed, halleluiah, and have mercy upon me.<br>
<br>
With the blessed martyrs, who loved you, and with the saints, who
pleased you by their way of life, make memory of our departed; make
them worthy to stand at your right hand, halleluiah, and give them rest.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Quqlion</span><br>
<br>
Blessed is he whose iniquity is forgiven, halleluiah, and whose sins are hidden:<br>
<br>
Because I was silent, my bones wasted away, halleluiah, while I cried out all the day.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

In the evening Abraham called upon you on the mountain-top and you

<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
On you soul and body call, that you may have compassion on them, while
they are in this world; when the one is separated from the other, they
cannot make petition for their offences at the seat of judgment,
halleluiah, have compassion on them both.<br>

We call upon you, Lord our Lord, come to our help, hear our petition and have mercy on our souls.<br>
<br>
In the evening when the light of the sun sets upon the earth, may I be
enlightened, Lord, to praise your creation; may your word be a lamp to
my feet, Son of God, and in place of the sun may it give light to me,
and I will walk by it.<br>
<br>
In the time of evening instead of all sacrifices give thanks, and
instead of holocausts offer pure prayer in love; and he who has mouth
and word and tongue ought to give thanks for the creatures which are
silent.<br>
<br>
The evening has come upon me and has placed me in the watch of the
night; be to me a sun, Lord, in the evening and I will walk by You.<br>
