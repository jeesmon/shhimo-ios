Lord's Prayer</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

<br>

Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread: and forgive us our debts and sins, as we also have
forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
the evil one. For Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory,
forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.<br>

Hail Mary</span><br>

<br>

Hail, Mary, full of Grace, our Lord is with thee; blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, our Lord Jesus
Christ. Oh Virgin Saint Mary, Oh Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at all times, and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br>

<br>

I<span style="font-weight: bold;">ntroductory Prayer of Soutoro</span><br>

<br>

Protect us, Lord, beneath the wings of your&nbsp; loving kindness and turn
our hard hearts to the knowledge of your truth; grant us to know and to
consider that the evening which has called us to rest and refreshment
from labor is a figure of the end of this present life; that we may be
diligent in good actions which are pleasing to your will, and we will
offer your praise and thanksgiving, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; now
and always and forever and ever. Amen.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Qolo</span><br>

<br>

I have considered all things and I have not seen anything better than
the fear of the Lord; blessed is he who has loved it.&nbsp; Joseph the just
loved it and he became king in Egypt; Moses the great loved it and he
divided the sea with his staff; Hananiah and his companions loved it
and it delivered them from the fire.&nbsp; It is more desirable than gold
and sweeter than the honeycomb; blessed is he who loves the fear of the
Lord.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">
Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">
Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>

<br>

Paul wrote me a letter and I sat down and read it, and, while I was
reading it, tears flowed from my eyes; for it is written there: woe to
adulterers and shame upon thieves: against it is written: for the
blasphemers there is a fire which is not quenched.&nbsp; Woe to me, for all
these things I have done from my youth!&nbsp; Like the sinful woman I cry to
you, and like the publican I beseech you: merciful Lord, have pity and
mercy upon me.<br>

Moryo rahem alain wuw’adarain (Lord have mercy upon us and help us)</span><br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">
B’outho of Mar Ephrem</span><br>

<br>

Lord, have mercy upon us, Lord, receive our service.<br>

<br>

We have angered you, Lord, by our deeds and you are not pleased to be
angry; for you are full of great compassion and your serenity is not
disturbed.<br>

<br>

All peoples together are but a drop, as is said in the prophet: how shall iniquity be found to disturb your serenity?<br>

<br>

You who hear prayers and respond to requests, hear our prayer and be
reconciled with us and respond in your mercy to our requests.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Psalms of Soutoro (Ps. 91, 121)</span><br>

<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">
Kurielaison, Kurielaison, Kurielaison</span>, He sits under the protection of the Most High, and glories in the shelter of God.<br>

<br>

I said to the Lord, my trust is in your, God is my refuge in whom I trust.<br>

<br>

He shall deliver you from the snare which makes you stumble, and from talk of vain things.<br>

<br>

He will keep you safe under his feathers and you shall be protected beneath his wings, his truth shall enclose you as an armor.<br>

<br>

You shall not be afraid of the terror of the night, or of the arrow which flies by day.<br>

<br>

Of the word which walks in the darkness, or of the spirit that wastes at midday.<br>

<br>

Thousands shall fall at your side and ten thousand at your right hand<br>

<br>

But it shall not come near to you, but with your eyes alone you shall see.<br>

<br>

You shall see the reward of the wicked, because you, Lord are my trust.<br>

<br>

You have made your dwelling I the heights, evil shall not come near you.<br>

<br>

Affliction shall not come near your tent, because he has commanded his angels concerning you.<br>

<br>

That they should keep you in all your ways, and receive you in their arms;<br>

<br>

That you may not stumble with your foot, you shall tread upon the asp and the basilisk<br>

<br>

You shall tread upon the lion and the dragon, because he has cried to me, I will deliver him and strengthen him.<br>

<br>

Because he has known my name he shall call upon me and I will answer him, I will be with him in distress. <br>

<br>

I will strengthen him and honor him; I will satisfy him with length of days.<br>

<br>

I will show him my salvation; I have lifted up my eyes to the hills.<br>

<br>

From whence will come my help, my help is from the Lord,<br>

<br>

Who made heaven and earth, he will not suffer your foot to slip.<br>

<br>

Your guardian shall not sleep, indeed he neither slumbers no sleeps.<br>

<br>

The guardian of Israel, the Lord is your guardian.<br>

<br>

The Lord shall shelter you with his right hand, by day the sun shall not harm you,<br>

<br>

Nor the moon by night, the Lord shall guard you from all evil.<br>

<br>

The Lord shall guard your soul, he shall guard your going out and coming in.<br>

<br>

From henceforth and forever more.<br>

<br>

And to you belongs the praise, O God, Barekmor.<br>

Prayer of St. Severus </span><br>

<br>

He dwells under the protection of the Most High, beneath the shadow of the wings of your loving kindness.<br>

<br>

Protect us, Lord, and have mercy upon us; you who hear all, hear the prayer of servants in your loving kindness. <br>

<br>

An evening full of peace and a night of holiness, grant us, Christ our Savior, for you are the king of glory.<br>

<br>

To you our eyes are turned, pardon our offences and our sins; in this world and in the world to come, have mercy on us.<br>

<br>

Lord let your mercy protect us and your grace rest upon our faces, let your cross guard us from the evil on and his powers.<br>

<br>

May your right hand rest upon us all the days of our life, and your
peace reign among us and give hope and salvation to the souls of those
who pray to you.<br>

<br>

By the prayers of Mary who bore you and of all the saints, pardon me, Lord, and have mercy upon me, O God.<br>
