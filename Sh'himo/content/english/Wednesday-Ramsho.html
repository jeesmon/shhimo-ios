<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lord's Prayer</span><br>
<br>
Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread: and forgive us our debts and sins, as we also have
forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
the evil one. For Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory,
forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hail Mary</span><br>
<br>
Hail, Mary, full of Grace, our Lord is with thee; blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, our Lord Jesus
Christ. Oh Virgin Saint Mary, Oh Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at all times, and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Introductory Prayer of Ramsho</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Grant us, Lord god, that while our bodies rest from the labors of the
day and our souls are released from worldly thoughts, we may stand in
your presence with tranquility at this time of evening and that we may
offer you ceaseless praise and uninterrupted thanksgiving; that we may
acknowledge your loving kindness by which you direct and rule our
lives, and protect and save our souls; to you we offer praise and
thanksgiving, now and always and forever. Amen<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Psalms of Ramsho (Ps. 141, 142, 119:105-112, 117)</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Kurielaison</span> Lord, I have called upon you, answer me: hear and receive my words.<br>
<br>
Let my prayer be like incense in your sight, the offering of my hands
like the evening offering.&nbsp; Set a guard, Lord, before my mouth, a
guard before my lips that my heart may not turn to evil words and I may
not do deeds of wickedness.<br>
<br>
Let me not take salt with impious men; let the just man teach me and
reprove me: let not the oil of the impious anoint my head; because my
prayer was against their evil-doing: their judges have been restrained
by the side of the rock; and they have heard how gentle are my words. <br>
<br>
As when a plough cleaves the earth their bones have been scattered at
the mouth of Sheol.&nbsp; I have lifted my eyes to you, Lord, and in
you have I put my trust, do not cast away my soul.<br>
<br>
Keep me from the hand of the proud, who have laid snares for me; let the wicked fall into their nets, while I pass on.<br>
With my voice I cried to the Lord; with my voice I besought the Lord
and poured my prayer before him; I showed him my affliction, when my
spirit was troubled, but you know my path.<br>
In the way of my walking they have laid a snare for me; I look to the
right and see none that knows me: the way of escape has gone from me
and there is none who cares for my soul, I cried to you, Lord, and
said: you are my hope and my portion in the land of the living.<br>
<br>
Hear my petition because I am brought very low; deliver me from my
persecutors because they are too strong for me.&nbsp; Lead me forth
from prison that I may give thanks to your name: your just ones shall
have hope when you shall reward me.<br>
<br>
Your word is a lamp to my feet and light to my path; I have sworn and
am resolved to keep the judgments of your justice.&nbsp; I am greatly
brought low, Lord, give me life according to your word; be pleased with
the words of my mouth, Lord, and teach me your judgments.<br>
<br>
My soul is ever in my hands, and I have no forgotten your law; sinners
have laid snares for me and I have not strayed from your
commands.&nbsp; I shall inherit your testimony forever because it is
dear to my heart; I have turned my heart to do your commands forever in
truth.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Praise the Lord, all you nations; praise him, all you peoples; for his grace is strong over us, truly the Lord is forever.<br>
<br>
And to you belongs the praise, O God. Barekmor.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>

We beseech you, mother of God, that with us and for us you&nbsp; may be
our intercessor with the king of kings, that he may make his peace and
calm to dwell in all the world, and make to pass the scourge of wrath
from all the world in his mercy. Stomen Kalos, Kurielaison<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Praise the Lord, you righteous</span><br>
With smoke of incense let memory be made of the virgin Mary, mother of God.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
With smoke of incense let memory be made of the doctors and priests and the just and righteous. <br>
<br>
May the memory of Mary be for our blessing and may her prayer be a stronghold to our souls.<br>
<br>
Behold, a sweet perfume breathes on the air for the virgin Mary the mother of God.<br>
<br>
Blessed are the prophets, blessed are the apostles, blessed are the martyrs on the day of the resurrection<br>
<br>
The martyrs who longed to see Christ obtained wings by the sword and flew to the heights<br>
<br>
Just judge, who judge justly, do not enter into judgment with us and do not remember our sins<br>
<br>
Come, Lord, to our help and strengthen our weakness, for in you is our hope by night and by day.<br>
<br>
In the Jerusalem which is above before the throne of Christ may memory be made of the faithful departed.<br>
<br>
Have pity, Lord, on the bodies which are corrupted in Sheol; renew their form and have pity on their sins.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">In heaven and on earth and in Eden, halleluia</span><br>
May a good memory be made in the four quarters of the earth in the
churches and the monasteries of the virgin Mary, who was pure and holy
in her virginity and was pleasing to the king of kings, who descended
and dwelt in her womb; her memory is in heaven and on earth, may her
prayer be a stronghold for us; give us a share, Lord, in the memory of
your mother.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>Glory to the Son of God, who was pleased to come forth from the
blessed holy virgin; by her ear she received him and she bore him in
her womb; he came forth from her womb and it remained sealed and
confounded the unbelievers.&nbsp; Praise to him, who so humbled
himself; praise to him, who saved his church, and behold, she sings
praise.<br>
<br>
Apostles, make intercession to him who chose you, that schisms and
disputes cease in the Church and among her children; behold disputants
surround her on every side to hide the faith which you preached to her;
may you truth, Lord, be a crucible which may try her words like gold,
may her priests cry in triumph: blessed is he who has magnified his
church. <br>
<br>
Your martyrs saw him, who inclined his head on the wood, sitting at the
right hand and weaving your crowns; therefore you thought nothing of
every torture and cleansed your limbs in the blood of you necks;
blessed are you, who trod under foot all pain and desired the love of
Christ, and, behold, your memories are celebrated in heaven and on
earth.<br>
<br>
You are a wise physician, O Mar (X), to whom our Lord gave authority to
heal the afflicted.&nbsp; Behold, our assembly takes refuge in the
sanctuary of you bones; by your prayers may all our petitions be
granted; health to the sick, refreshment to the weary; return to those
who are far away and to us forgiveness of offences.<br>
<br>
To you, Lord, we call, come to our aid; for, behold, the evil one by
his craft troubles the world; he has stirred up war among kings and
disturbed judged, and if it were possible, he would cause to err even
the elect, as it is written; in what, Lord shall we take refuge, if not
in your mercy?&nbsp; Drive away the evil one from us by the sign of
your cross.<br>
<br>
Judge of judges, do not make me bow my head at the seat of judgment
because of my offenses, by which I have sinned and angered you; and if
I am not worthy of forgiveness, have pity on me because of your body
and blood which is buried within me; I have loved you and worshipped
your cross, and I have been absolved by your body and blood; be
appeased by them and forgive me, Jesus, full of mercy.<br>
<br>
You who died in Christ, do not be grieved; for behold the resurrection
has come and the day of retribution; you shall rise from your graves
without corruption and go forth with speed to meet the Son of the King;
you shall be clothed in a garment of glory and shall sing praise before
him; you who raise up the sons of Adam, have pity and mercy upon us.<br>
<br>
Joseph died and was buried in the land of Egypt; a place which is
foreign to the land of promise; and when he was dying he commanded his
brothers and made them swear to take up his bones from thence to the
land of Canaan; so also with our brothers who have slept in your hope
and were separated from their people and their kindred, the power which
was with Joseph shall be with them.<br>

The daughter of the king stood in glory, halleluiah and halleluiah, and the queen at your right hand.<br>
<br>
Forget your people and your father’s house, halleluiah and halleluiah, for the king shall desire your beauty.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

He has looked with mercy on the affliction of his handmaid; he who magnifies his mother, he who is the holy God. <span style="font-style: italic;">Stomen Kalos, Kurielaison.</span><br>

<br>
You strengthened me and I carried you, said Mary; and when, I bore you
in the cave, you showed me your glory.&nbsp; Flames surround the little
crib and the Seraphim with six wings fly above it.&nbsp; Command them
to raise their wings that I may enter, Lord, and kneel and worship you;
and I will give you pure milk which shall be pleasing to your will.<br>
<br>
Glory to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.<br>
Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.<br>
<br>
In the law and in prophecy Moses, the head of the prophets represented
the figure of the blessed mother, by the ark of the law and the pot of
manna, and by the staff of Aaron which budded within the holy of
holies, and by the dew and the fleece of Gideon and by the new jar of
Elisha and by the light cloud of the glorious Isaiah.<br>

<br>
Make us to share, Lord, in the memory of your mother and of your
saints; by their prayers have pity on us, Lord, and on our departed.<br>
<br>
O daughter of David, you have great freedom with that king who disposes
of all kings; we beseech you, pearl without flaw, to intercede for us
with that fruit which came forth from you.<br>
<br>
O you departed, who dwell in the grave, take courage; there is good
news for you: behold, the resurrection has drawn near to its coming;
the word which formed you in the womb of woman will call you and will
raise up your bodies without corruption.<br>
<br>
Above in heaven and here on earth in the Church may there be a memory
of the blessed virgin and the saints and the faithful departed.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Concluding Prayer&nbsp; of Ramsho</span><br>
<br>
O Jesus Christ our Lord, close not the door of Thy mercy upon our
faces.&nbsp; We confess that we are sinners; have mercy upon us.&nbsp;
O Lord, Thy love for us, didst make Thee to come down to us from Thy
place.&nbsp; That by Thy death, our death might be abolished; Have
mercy upon us. Amen.<br>
