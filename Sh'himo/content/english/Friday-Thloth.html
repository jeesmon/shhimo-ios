<br>
Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread: and forgive us our debts and sins, as we also have
forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
the evil one. For Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory,
forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hail Mary</span><br>
<br>
Hail, Mary, full of Grace, our Lord is with thee; blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, our Lord Jesus
Christ. Oh Virgin Saint Mary, Oh Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at all times, and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Introductory Prayer of Third Hour</span><br>

Cleanse us, Lord, by repentance and by tears of compunction from every
passion and stain and defilement of sin, and grant us the grace of
victory in our lives at all times and for all the days of our life,
Father, Son &amp; Holy Spirit, now and always and forever, Amen.<br>

</span>At the Third Hour and at all time we worship the living cross,
and we sign ourselves with it on our foreheads; it is our hope and
protection, it delivers us from the evil one and his powers by day and
night.<br>
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>
<br>
Moses with his staff divided the sea before the host and Israel passed
over; our Lord Jesus by the cross of light opened Sheol and raised the
dead; blessed is Christ, who trod for us the way of lives from the
grave to Paradise.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">B’outho of Mar Jacob</span><br>
<br>
Son, who by your cross delivered the Church form error, grant her your peace and keep her children by the cross of light.<br>
<br>
O cross, which revealed wondrous powers to the sons of men; by you may
the horn of the Church be exalted now and always; the cross is light
and it clothes its worshippers in light; grant light to the eyes of my
mind that I may see your light.<br>
<br>
Great Savior, who saved your Church from error, save me in my weakness
on the day when the judgment is given; on this festival we are
assembled before your cross; on that eternal festival may I see your
compassion and praise your name.<br>
<br>
By the mercy, which showed compassion to the thief on the right hand,
have compassion on us, Son of God, and have mercy upon us.&nbsp; <br>
