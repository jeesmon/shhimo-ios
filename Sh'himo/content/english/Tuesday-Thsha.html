I<span style="font-weight: bold;">ntroductory Prayer of Ninth Hour</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">






<br>






Receive, Lord, the souls of your servants in tabernacles of light and
make them to dwell in the harbor of blessedness; give them rest in the
glorious bosom of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the Patriarchs, that on
the great day of your glorious manifestation we may stand with them at
your right hand, and offer fitting praise to you and your Father and
your Holy Spirit, now and always and forever, Amen.<br>






<br>






<span style="font-weight: bold;">Qolo</span><br>






<br>






O you who died in Christ, do not be grieved, for behold, the
resurrection has come and the day of retribution; you shall rise from
your graves without corruption and go forth with speed to meet the Son
of the King; you shall be clothed in a garment of glory and shall
sing praise before him; O resurrection of the sons of Adam, have pity
and mercy upon us. <br>






<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">





Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">





Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</span><br>






<br>






It was the custom of the just of old, that for three days they should
offer incense for the departed; and when our Lord Jesus was placed in
the tomb and enshrouded by the Holy Spirit by angels and men, they
offered incense for him the living, who created Adam from dust; to your
servants for whom we offer incense give rest in your mercy.<br>

<br>






Give rest to those in the grave, heavenly King, and multiply forgiveness to the faithful departed.<br>






<br>






In the bosom of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob make them rest, Lord, your servants who have slept in your hope.<br>






Glory to Christ who calls the dead and they rise without corruption and sing praise.<br>

Their bodies and their souls shall cry together: blessed is he who has come and will come and raise the dead.<br>
