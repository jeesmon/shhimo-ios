<br>
Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread: and forgive us our debts and sins, as we also have
forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
the evil one. For Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory,
forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.<br>

now and at all times, and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Introductory Prayer of Lilio</span><br>
<br>
Awaken us, Lord, from our sleep in the sloth of sin that we may praise
your watchfulness, you who watch and do not sleep; give life to our
death in the sleep of death and corruption, that we may adore your
compassion, you who live and do not die; grant us in the glorious
company of the angels who praise you in heaven, to praise you and bless
you in holiness, because you are praised and blessed in heaven and on
earth, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and always and forever. Amen. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Psalms of Lilio (Ps. 134, 119:169-176, 117)</span><br>
<br>
Bless the Lord, all you servants of the Lord.<br>
<br>
You who stand by night in the house of the Lord.<br>
<br>
May the Lord bless you from Zion, He who made heaven and earth.<br>
<br>
Let my praise enter before You, Lord, and give me life by Your word; let my cry enter before You, <br>
<br>
My tongue shall pour forth Your word, because all Your commands are just.<br>
<br>
My lips shall speak Your praise when You have taught me Your commands;
let Your hand help me because I have taken pleasure in Your commands.<br>
<br>
My soul has longed for Your salvation and I have meditated on Your law;
let my soul live and I will praise You and Your judgments shall help me.<br>
I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek for Your servant, because I have not forgotten all Your commands<br>
<br>
Praise the Lord, all you nations, praise Him, all you peoples; because His grace is strong over us, the <br>
Lord is truly forever. <br>
<br>
And to you belongs the praise, O God, Barekmor.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Eniono<br>
<br>
</span>Why do you love sleep more than praise, my soul, and how long
will you be engrossed in pleasures which do not profit? Awake now and
rise and sing praise: Lord of all, to you the praise.<br>
<br>
O you wretched soul, rouse yourself to prayer and stand and beseech the
judge, that he may not condemn you on the day of judgment; on that day
of your judgment have mercy on us, Lord of all.<br>
<br>
Behold the time of repentance, let every man turn from his iniquity,
before the time passes and there is no place for repentance; do not
reward us according to our iniquity; Lord of all, to you the praise.<br>
<br>
Job cried from the dunghill and Daniel from within the den; the three
young men cried to you in the furnace, and you delivered them from the
fire; like them we call upon you; Lord of all, to you the praise.<br>
<br>
The Lord beheld the earth trembling because of the iniquity of its
inhabitants, and the foundations of the world shook, because great was
the impiety within; do not reward us according to our iniquity; Lord of
all, to you the praise.<br>
<br>
Forgive me, forgive me, cried the sinful woman at the house of Simon,
and our Lord answered and said to her: go, woman, your sins are
forgiven, your iniquity is blotted out; Lord of all, to you the praise.<br>
<br>
Before he sinned, David said: let sinners perish; but after he had
sinned, he said: my Lord and my God, have mercy on me; do not reward us
according to our iniquity; Lord of all, to you the praise.<br>
<br>
Lord, do not rebuke us in your anger, for we have not strength to bear
it, and do not punish us in your wrath, for we are not able to stand
before you; and do not reward us according to our iniquity; Lord of
all, to you the praise.<br>
<br>
The children of the Ninevites asked their fathers, when shall we die,
as the Hebrew wrote to us. Do not reward us according to our iniquity;
Lord of all, to you the praise.<br>
<br>
Pardon and forgive the offences of our fathers and our brothers who
have gone to their rest, and write their names in the book of life in
your kingdom, and let them stand at your right hand on the day when
your majesty appears.<br>

Mary said: My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God,

<br>
Because He who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is His
name. And His mercy is from generation to generation on those who fear
Him.<br>
<br>
He has won victory with His arm, He has scattered the proud in the
conceit of their heart. He has put down the mighty from their thrones,
and has exalted the lowly.<br>
<br>
He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich He has sent
empty away. He has given help to Israel His servant, mindful of His
mercy. Even as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and His seed forever.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lord's Prayer</span><br>
<br>
Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread: and forgive us our debts and sins, as we also have
forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
the evil one. For Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory,
forever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hail Mary</span><br>
<br>
Hail, Mary, full of Grace, our Lord is with thee; blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, our Lord Jesus
Christ. Oh Virgin Saint Mary, Oh Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at all times, and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br>
